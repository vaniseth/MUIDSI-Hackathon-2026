Components of Higher Education Act compliance regarding campus safety and security reporting: Basic requirements and time frames ........................................................................................................... 1-9 This page intentionally left blank. Introduction: An Overview of Campus Safety And Security Reporting CHAPTER 1 Choosing a postsecondary institution is a major decision for students and their families. Along with academic, financial and geographic considerations, the issue of campus safety is a vital concern. In 1990, Congress enacted the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990 (Title II of Public Law 101-542), which amended the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( HEA). This act required all postsecondary institutions participating in HEAs Title IV student financial assistance programs to disclose campus crime stat istics and security information. The act was amended in 1992, 1998, 2000 and 2008. The 1998 amendments renamed the law the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act in memory of a student who was slain in her dorm room in 1986. It is generally referred to as the Clery Act and is in section 485(f) of the HEA. On March 7, 2013, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA) (Public Law 113-14) was signed into law. VAWA includes amendments to the Clery Act . These changes require institutions to disclose statistics, policies and programs related to dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking , among other changes. Specifically, these changes added or modified requirements related to disclosure of statistics of the number of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking incidents; disclosure of statistics of new categories of Hate Crimes; implementation by institutions and disclosure of programs to prevent dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, including primary prevention and awareness programs for incoming students and employees; and The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 1-1 Chapter 1. Introduction: An Overview of Campus Se curity 1-2 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns for students and employees; disclosure of procedures victims should follow if a crime of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking has occurred; and implementation by institutions and disclosure of procedures for institutional disciplinary action in cases of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, including descriptions of each disciplinary proceeding used by the institution, the standard of evidence used during each disciplinary proceeding, possible sanctions imposed following the results of disciplinary proceedings , and the range of protective measures that the institution may offer a victim; provisions to ensure that proceedings will be prompt, fair and impartial; provisions that state that proceedings will be conducted by officials who r eceive annual training; and ensuring equal opportunities for the accuser and accused to have others present during proceedings, including an advisor of their choice.

Although the HEA is the law that governs the administration of all federal higher education programs, as used in this handbook, HEA refers only to the Clery Act and other safety- and security -related requirements applicable to institutions under the HEA . How to Determine If Your Institution Must Comply With the HEA Does your institution participate in federal Title IV student financial assistance programs? All public and private postsecondary institutions that participate in any of the Title IV programs must comply with t he HEA. Title IV institutions hav e signed Program Participation Agreements (PPAs) with the U.S. Although the HEA is the law that governs the administration of all federal higher education programs, as used in this handbook, HEA refers only to the Clery Act and other safety - and security -related requirements applicable to institutions under the HEA. Chapter 1. Introduction: An Overview of Campus Security The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 1-3 Department of Education (the Department) to administer these financial assistance programs. The programs include Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational O pportunity Grants (FSEOGs) , the Federal Work -Study Program , Federal Perkins Loans, the Federal Direct Loan Program , and the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP). If you are not sure whether your institution participates in the Title IV prog rams, contact your institutions financial aid officer or chief executive officer. Note that: Your institution must comply with the HEAs requirements beginning on the date your PPA goes into effect (i.e., the date it is signed by the secretary of educati on). If your institution is Title IV eligible, but has a location or locations that serve students who are not receiving Title IV student aid, you must still comply with the Clery Act and other safety- and security-related HEA requirements for all locations. These requirements apply based on institutional eligibility, not location eligibility. If your institution primarily serves secondary school students, but enrolls even one postsecondary school student and participates in the Title IV programs, you must comply. If your institution does not participate in the Title IV programs or has a deferment only status (i.e., it does not provide student loans or grants through Title IV programs but does have students who are eligible to defer federal student loans while they are enrolled in your school), you are not required to comply with the requirements described in this handbook. Title IV institutions that are exempt from compliance: If your institution is a distance education -only school and your students are never present on a physical campus, you do not have to comply with the requirements discussed in this handbook. This means that students do not go to a physical location to enroll, seek guidance, study, work, intern, etc. The Chapter 1.

Introduction: An Overview of Campus Se curity 1-4 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting only exception to this rule is an annual graduation ceremony. If the only time students are present on a physical campus is to attend a graduation ceremony at a location that your institution owns or controls, your institution is still exempt from compliance. Foreign institutions are exempt from the requirements; however, foreign campuses of U.S. institutions are not exempt and must comply with the Clery Act and other safety - and security -related requirements discussed in this handbook. If you have determined that your institution is a Title IV institution and must comply, read on. Purpose of the Handbook This handbook reflects the Department s interpretations and guidance, as of the date of publication, and was written to assist you, in a step- by-step and readable manner, in understanding and meeting the various HEA requirements. It is intended for use by the Department s program reviewers who are responsible for evaluating an institutions compliance with the requirements as well as postsecondary institutions and outside reviewers. This revised handbook replaces the previous versions of the handbook. It does not supplant or replace the HEA. The HEA and its regulations take precedence if there are any differences between them and the handbook. Your institution is responsible for ensur ing that it complies with any changes made to them . Handbook Organization Chapter 2 assists you in laying the proper foundation for complying with the Clery Act and other HEA safety- and security-related reporting requirements by explaining the important role geography has in complying with the law and its regulations. We discuss in detail how to identify which buildings and property owned or controlled by your institution fall into the various HEA -related geographic categories. Getting this foundation right is key to knowing what crimes and fires to report and in which reporting categories to include them; This revised handbook replaces the previous versions of the handbook.

Subsequent chapters describe and discuss the various requirements by topic. We suggest reading the chapters in order because some chapters contain information that builds upon previous topics. For example, Chapter 3 provides definitions of crimes and discusses how to count those that occur on your Clery Act geography for inclusion in your statistics.

Chapter 4 helps you determine from whom within your institution and from which local law enforcement agencies you must obtain such crime information. There are also cross -references throughout the handbook for t he times you just want to research a particular regulation or issue. The handbook also contains citations for the applicable laws and regulations, highlights important information in side notes, provides examples of crime and fire scenarios, and suggests h elpful practices to assist you in determining if your policies and procedures are compliant. There are a number of appendices at the back of the handbook, which are referenced throughout the chapters, along with an index to help you locate specific terms and topics, and a list of abbreviations used frequently throughout the handbook. And, because no handbook could cover every situation, help desk contact information is provided if you need further assistance. The Requirements The HEA contains specific campus safety - and security- related requirements, but allows institutions a great deal of flexibility in complying with them. This flexibility acknowledges the myriad differences in types, locations and configurations of postsecondary schools. Although all institutions have immediate, ongoing and annual We suggest reading the chapters in order because some chapters contain information that builds upon previous topics. Chapter 1. Introduction: An Overview of Campus Se curity 1-6 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting requirements , compliance might differ in some respects from one institution to another. For example, compliance for an institution with on -campus student housing facilities differs from compliance for a small commuter school located in a strip mall. A single institution might have some different compliance requirements for each of its campuses. In any case, whatever the requirements are for your specific institution, they must be met completely and on time. As discussed throughout the handbook, remember to maintain detailed documentation of your compliance with each requirement. Institutions are routinely required to provide this documentation to Department officials during the conduct of program reviews. The requirements fall into three categories based on the configuration of an institution: (1) Clery Act crime statistics and security -related policy requirements that must be met by every institution; (2) an additional Clery Act crime log requirement for institutions that have a campus police or security department; and (3) HEA missing stude nt notification and fire safety requirements for institutions t hat have at least one on-campus student housing facility. Following is a list of the requirements by category along with the number of the applicable handbook chapter or chapters. 1. Every instit ution must do the following : Collect, classify and count crime reports and crime statistics. The regulatory requirements for classifying and counting crimes are discussed in Chapter 3.

The regulatory requirements regarding these topics are discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Provide educational programs and campaigns. To promote the awareness of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, you must provide primary prevention and awareness programs to all incoming students and new employees; and provide ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns for students and employees. The regulatory requirements regarding these topics are discuss ed in detail in Chapter 8. Have procedures for institutional disciplinary action in cases of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. Disclose your policy and procedures in the annual security report. The regulatory requirements regarding these topics are also discussed in detail in Chapter 8. Publish an annual security report containing safety- and security -related policy statements and crime statistics and distribute it to all current students and employees. Schools also must inform prospective students and employees about the availability of the report. The regulatory requirements regarding crime statistics are discussed in Chapter 3 and the regulatory requirements for the annual security report are discussed in Chapters 79. Submit crime statistics to the Department . Each year in the fall you must participate in a Web -based data collection to disclose crime statistics by type, location and year.

Introduction: An Overview of Campus Security The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 1-9 Compliance Timetable Compliance with the HEAs campus safety - and security - related requirements is not a once-a- year event. Many requirements must be satisfied before an institution can be considered in full compliance. Some requirements are ongoing, such as crime information collecting, campus alerts and log updating, while other requirements are less frequent, such as the annual reports and the online survey you submit to the Department . Table 1 is an overview of the basic requirements and time frames for the main components of compliance. (Note that Appendix C provides a detailed checklist for compliance.) Table 1. Components of Higher Education Act compliance regarding campus safety and security reporting: Basic requirements and time frames What to Do When to Do It Have emergency notification and evacuation procedures for alerting the campus community about significant emergencies or dangerous situations. Disclose your policies and procedures in the annual security report. Use emergency notification procedures whenever there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees on campus. Have in place primary and ongoing prevention and awareness programs and campaigns for students and employees. Disclose your policies and procedures in the annual security report. Provide the primary education programs as part of the orientation process for new students and employees whenever they start. Ongoing campaigns should be visible throughout the year. Issue timely warnings to alert the campus community about crimes that pose a serious or continuing threat to safety. Disclose your policy in the annu al security report. Issue a warning whenever there is a threat that a crime is ongoing or may be repeated.

In addition to providing guidance on the implementation of regulations , and collecting and disseminating crime and fire data to Congress and the public, the U.S. Department of Education is also responsible for monitoring compliance. The Department can issue civil fine s of up to 35,000 per violation for a substantial misrepresentation of the number, location or nature of the crimes required to be reported or for a violation of any other provision of the safety- and security-related HEA regulations. Final Program Review Determination Reports are public records. Note that the HEA includes a whistle-blower protection provision making it clear that nothing in the law shall be construed to permit a school to take retaliatory action against a nyone with respect to the implementation of the Clery Act and the other HEA safety- and security -related requirements in the HEA and the Department s regulations. Again, Chapter 2 presents a detailed look at Clery Act geography, what it is and why its th e cornerstone of safety - and security -related reporting. We strongly urge you to read it prior to reading the remaining handbook chapters, even if you are a reporting veteran. This page intentionally left blank. The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-1 Geography: Location, Location, Location CHAPTER 2 Geographic breakdown citation 34 CFR 668.46(c)(4) The Clery Act requires institutions to disclose statistics for reported crimes based on where the crimes occurred, to whom the crimes were reported, the types of crimes that were reported, and the year in which the crimes were reported. This chapter identifies and breaks down the physical parameters of reporting and explains how to apply these parameters to institutions of different sizes and in different settings. You must disclose statistics for reported Clery Act crimes that occur (1) on campus, (2) on public property within or immediately adjacent to the campus, and (3) in or on noncampus buildings or property that your institution owns or controls. The definitions for these geographic categories are Clery Act -specific and are the same for every institution regardless of its physical size or configuration. It doesnt matter whether your campus consists of leased space in a strip mall, occupies 10 city blocks or consists of a couple of buildings on another schools campus. Clery Act geography is defined the same way.

It doesnt matter whether your campus consists of leased space in a strip mall, occupies 10 city blocks or consists of a couple of buildings on another schools campus. Clery Act geography is defined the same way. Understanding each of these geographic categories as defined by the Clery Act is vital to complying with the law. You must provide a breakdown of the statistics by category. You must disclose, for example, an A ggravated Assault that occurred on your campus, or on the public sidewalk in front of your campus or in a high school classroom in a nearby city that your institution rents for creative writing classes. Remember, location is the key here crimes that dont occur within your Clery Act geography are not included in your Clery Act statistics, even if your students or employees are involved. As you read through the description of each of the three categories, it may be helpful to create a list of the buildings and The definitions for these geographic categories are Clery Act -specific and are the same for every institution regardless of its physical size or configuration. Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-2 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting properties associated with your institution that fit each defined area. How to Identify Your On-campus Geography On-campus definition citation 34 CFR 668.46(a) Under the Clery Act , the on-campus category includes the following: Any building or property owned or controlled by an institution within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area and used by the institution i n direct support of, or in a manner related to, the institutions educational purposes, including residence halls; and Any building or property that is within or reasonably contiguous to the area identified in paragraph (1) of this definition, that is owne d by the institution but controlled by another person, is frequently used by students, and supports institutional purposes (such as a food or other retail vendor). The first part of this definition states that, for Clery Act reporting purposes, your campus includes buildings and properties that meet all of the following criteria: Your institution owns or controls them; They are reasonably contiguous to one another; and They directly support or relate to the institutions educational purposes. So what does this mean? Controlled by means that your institution (or an institution -associated entity as described below) directly or indirectly rents, leases or has some other type of written agreement (including an informal one, such as a letter or an e-mail) for use of a building or property, or a portion of a building or property. Even if there is no payment involved in the transaction, for Clery Act purposes, a written agreement for the use of space gives your institution control of that space for the time period specified in the agreement. For example, if your campus consists of leased space comprising the entire third floor of an office building, you are in control of the third Chapter 2.

For example, if your campus consists of leased space comprising the entire third floor of an office building, you are in control of the third Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-3 floor. A reported crime that occurs on the third floor (rooms, hallway, restrooms), or in the lobby, stairwell or elevator that students must use to access the third floor, is considered to have occurred on campus. If the agreement gives your institution use of the parking lot or specific spaces in the lot, the parking lot or the specified section of the lot is also part of your on-campus geography. To emphasize: Your control extends as far as the space specified in your written agreement along with any area your students and employees have to use to access that space. So, if you lease the third floor of the building and a crime occurs on an elevator in the building during the period of time covered by your lease, you must include that crime in your Clery Act statistics. Note that for the purposes of the C lery Act, if you have an institution -associated foundation, holding company, subsidiary, alumni association, athletic booster club, or any other institution -associated entity that owns or controls a building or property that is operated in support of, or in relation to, your institutions educational purposes, your institution is considered to be in control of that building or property. State ownership of a building or property used in support of, or in relation to, the educational purposes of a state school also establishes institutional control of that building or property. Institution -associated hospitals andor medical centers that are controlled by your institution and reasonably contiguous with your campus should be included as part of your campus. Be yond formal legal arrangements, other factors that are considered in determining whether, for Clery Act purposes, the institution controls a hospital or medical center include overlapping facultydoctors, overlapping boards of directors or officers, use of the hospital or medical center as part of the institutions educational program, geographic proximity, an ongoing relationship between the institution and the hospital, and whether students consider the hospital or medical center to be part of the campus. Reasonably contiguous refers to a building or property your institution owns or controls thats in a location that you and your students consider to be, and treat as, part of your campus. An example might be a house two blocks from campus thats owned by your institution and which is used as an art studio for your students. Generally speaking, it is reasonable to consider locations within one mile of your campus border to be reasonably contiguous with your campus. However, this determination must be made on a case by case Chapter 2.

A location that is within one mile of campus but separated from campus by a river or a six -lane highway might not be considered contiguous unless a pedestrian bridge or tunnel connects the two sides. If you exclude from the definition of campus for Clery Act purposes a building or property your institution owns or controls that is within one mile of your campus you must be able to explain your basis for th is decision. Directly support, or relate to, the institutions educational purposes refers to the function of the building or property. For example, the dorms on your campus that house your students support the schools educational purposes. However, a high school that is located on your campus, but is otherwise not associated with your institution and is not used by your students or employees for any reason, does not. On the other hand, if the high school is used by your students and employees as part of y our institutions educational program it would be part of your campus. The second part of the on-campus definition requires you to include buildings and properties within your campus, or reasonably contiguous to it that meet all three of the following criteria: Your institution owns but does not control them; They are frequently used by your students; and They are used to support the institutions educational purposes. Examples are a bookstore or a fast -food restaurant that leases space in your student center. Remember that these entities are considered to be part of your on- campus geography because you own the building, your students frequently use the space, and it supports your institution. Joes Fried Chicken Emporium across the street from your student center would not be included in your on-campus geography even though many of your students eat there daily, if your institution does not own or control it. Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-5 Other On-campus Considerations Listed below are examples of how to apply the on- campus param eters to nontraditional campuses and multiple campuses. Institutions that share a campus: If your institution shares a campus with another Title IV institution, both institutions must include in their separate Clery Act statistics all of the Clery Act crimes that occur anywhere on the campus. The reasons for this are (1) the Clery Act requires every Title IV institution to report statistics and (2) crime statistics are maintained on the Departments public website and are retrieved for viewing by enter ing the name of a specific institution.

Your statistics must be available to any interested party who searches the websites database for your institution. Institutions that lease space on another institutions campus: If your institution leases some buildings and property on another institutions campus, your campus is determined by the specifics of that contract. For example, if you have sole use of a dorm, a classroom building, an administration building and a parking lot, that is your campus. If your contract also allows your students to share a dining hall with students from the host institution, that dining hall is also included. If the host institution also participates in Title IV programs, both schools must include the shared dining hall in their on-campus geography. Institutions that offer dual classes and degrees: If your institution has a partnership with another institution to offer dual classes and degrees and the agreement specifies only that your students can attend classes at the other institution and that the other schools students can attend classes at your school, you do not have to disclose reported Clery Act crimes that occur on the other campus because you do not own or control it. The other institution will need to include any crimes in its statistics even if the crimes involve students from your institution. Institutions that lease space in strip malls: Your campus consists of any space within the strip mall Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-6 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting that is covered by your written agreement. If the lease includes use of the parking lot, or selected spaces in the lot, include the lot (or selected spaces) as part of your campus. If your students need to use stairwells or elevators or hallways to access the space your institution controls, include them as part of your campus as well. Do not include any of the strip malls stores, restaurants, offices, etc., in your on-campus category unless your institution owns or controls them. Institutions located in institution -owned strip malls: Your campus consists of any space within the strip mall that is used for the institutions educational purposes. Do not include any of the strip malls stores, restaurants, offices, etc., in your on-campus category if your institution leases that space to private individuals and businesses, and the space isnt used for your institutions educational purposes. Institutions With More Than One Campus If your institution has more than one campus, each campus must comply independently with all of the Clery Act and the fire- and safety -related HEA requirements described in this handbook, including publishing its own annual security report as discussed in Chapter 9 (or your institution may publish and distribute to students and employees a single annual security report as long as", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 14, "word_count": 500}

For the purpose of these requirements, consider an additional location a separate campus if it meets all of the following criteria: Your institution owns or controls the site; It is not reasonably geographically contiguous with the main campus; It has an organized program of study; and There is at least one person on site acting in an administrative capacity. An organized program of study means that the location offers courses in educat ional programs leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized credential. If your institution has more than one campus, each campus must comply independently with all of the Clery Act and the fire- and safety - related HEA requirements described in this handbook . Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-7 Administrative personnel encompass a variety of individuals who may have some responsibility for the activities that take place at the location; administrative personnel include, for example, a director, a building coordinator, a registrar or a secretary. It is not necessary for administrative personnel to be on site at all times for the location to qualify as a separate campus; the location might share a rotating administrator who is scheduled to be on site once a week. If your institution owns or controls noncontiguous academic locations where students take a course or two and there are no administrative personnel on site, those are not separate campuses. For Clery Act reporting purposes, they are noncampus locations and they are discussed later in this chapter under How to Identify Your Noncampus Buildings or Property. Examples of separate campuses Branch campus definition citation 34 CFR 600.2 Bran ch: A branch campus is always a separate campus. Branch campus is a specific Department designation. It is defined as a location of an institution that is geographically apart and independent of the main campus of the institution. A location of an institution is considered independent of the main campus if the location is permanent in nature, offers courses in educational programs leading to a degree or other recognized educational credential, has its own faculty and administrative or supervisory organization, and has its own budgetary and hiring authority. School: A school is a division of an institution that is organized to give instruction of a defined type, such as a school o f business, law, medicine or nursing. A school may be, but is not always, a separate campus. For example, if your institution has a school of law that is reasonably geographically contiguous with the main campus, include it as part of your main campus.

Note that if you have a beauty school or technology school, etc., with multiple locations that each function as a main campus, each campus must comply independently with the Clery Acts requirements. Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-8 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Other locations: Other institution -owned or -controlled locations may include satellite, extension or similar types of noncontiguous sites that have an organized program of study and administrative personnel on- site. For example: Research campuses: If your institution owns a farm, agricultural or horticultural center, or other noncontiguous research facility that has an administrator on-site and that is used by students for recurring classes, recurring field trips, internships, student jobs or other regularly scheduled use, it should be considered a separate campus. If student attendance at these locations is determined by individual research needs and there is no regularly scheduled use of the facility by students (i.e., student use is sporadic), it is not a separate campus. Athletic campuses or complexes : If your institution owns a noncontiguous athletic complex that has administrator s on site and houses classrooms used for courses that are part of an organized program of study (for example, the complex includes one or more large auditorium- style classrooms to be used by large courses in any department, or houses one or more regular cl assrooms used for courses towards a golf course management degree), the athletic complex is a separate campus. Foreign locations: A foreign location that a U.S. institution owns or controls that has an organized program of study and administrative personnel on - site is a separate campus. Military bases: If your institution has a written agreement giving it use of a defined space within the base, and the location otherwise meets the definition of a campus, its a separate campus. If your school simply sends instructors to the base, its not a separate campus. Chapter 2.

This definition includes the following types of housing: Undergraduate, graduate and married student housing. Single family houses that are used for student housing. Summer school student housing. Buildings that are used for student housing but also have faculty, staff or other individuals living there. (Do not include faculty-only housing in this category. Institution -owned or controlled faculty-only housing that is located on the campus belongs only in the on-campus category.) Buildings that are owned by a third party that has a written agreement with your institution to provide student housing. It doesnt matter whether the rent is paid to the third party by the institution on behalf of the students or paid directly by the students. These Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-10 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting locations could include buildings that are used exclusively for student housing, or hotels or apartment buildings in which a sub- set of the available units have been leased for s tudent housing. In multi-use buildings that are reasonably contiguous with the campus, the portion of the building leased for student housing, as well as common areas and areas used to access the student housing, should be counted as an on-campus student housing facility. Include any unoccupied apartments that are specifically reserved for student housing. You do not have to include the apartments, rooms or floors of the building that are not reserved for student housing or apartments, or rooms or floors of the building that are reserved for faculty or staff. Housing for officially and not officially recognized student groups, including fraternity or sorority houses, that are owned or controlled by your institution or are located on property that your institution owns or controls. Parking facilities and dining halls that are physically attached to and accessed directly from student housing facilities must be included as part of the on-campus student housing facility.

Before Moving On Properly defining whats on campus is vitalnot just for disclosing on- campus crime statistics, but also for accurately identifying another category of Clery Act geography: public property. If you cant determine the boundaries of your campus under the C lery Act, you will not be able to properly identify your campus public property. Properly defining whats o n campus is vital not just for disclosing on-campus crime statistics, but also for accurately identifying another category of Clery Act geography : public property. Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-11 How to Identify Your Public Property Public property definition citation 34 CFR 668.46( a) Under the Clery Act , public property encompasses the following: All public property, including thoroughfares, streets, sidewalks, and parking facilities, that is within the campus, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. Public property refers to property owned by a public entity, such as a city or state government. An example of public property is a parking lot with a sign that reads, City of Rockville Public Parking. A parking lot with a sign that reads, Joes 24-Hour Parking is not public property despite the fact that the public can park there. No matter where your campus is located, your Clery Act public property category consists solely of two limited areas. The first is public prope rty within your campus. An example is a public road or public bike path that runs through the campus. You must report statistics for crimes that occur on the section of the road or bike path that touches your campus. A private road or private driveway running through your campus is not public property. A public or municipal parking lot that bisects your campus is part of your public property. A privately owned parking lot that bisects your campus is not. However, regardless of whether the parking lot is publicly or privately owned, if your institution has a written agreement giving it use of the parking lot, include the lot in your on-campus geography, not your public property geography. The second area is public property that immediately borders and is accessible from the campus. In many cases this property consists of a public sidewalk that borders the campus, the public street along the sidewalk and the public sidewalk on the other side of the street (i.e., sidewalk, street, sidewalk). Again, only the portions of the sidewalk, street and sidewalk that are adjacent to your campus are included in your public property. If you have an urban campus that comprise s 100", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 18, "word_count": 500}
{"chunk_id": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf_chunk_19", "text": "along the sidewalk and the public sidewalk on the other side of the street (i.e., sidewalk, street, sidewalk). Again, only the portions of the sidewalk, street and sidewalk that are adjacent to your campus are included in your public property. If you have an urban campus that comprise s 100 buildings that have public sidewalks and public streets separating them, the same rules apply. You must identify the public property associated with each of these campus buildings, generally: sidewalk, street, sidewalk. No matter where your campus is located, your Clery Act public property category consists solely of two limited areas . Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-12 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting So how do you determine whether the public property immediately adjacent to your campus is accessible? Look for one of two conditions to be present: There is no barrier of any kind between your campus border and public property. For example, you can step off your campus directly onto a public sidewalk. A standard of use has been established by your students. This means that although some type of barrier is present, your students frequently ignore, overcome or even use it, to gain access to public property. Some examples are: A wall that students frequently climb over. A fence that students frequently climb over, under or through. This includes a fence with a hole in it that students frequently crawl through. A fence with a missing or broken gate that students frequently walk or drive through. Other Public Property Considerations Sidewalk, street, sidewalk: Your public property does not include anything beyond the second sidewalk. (If there isnt a second sidewalk, it doesnt include anything beyond the street.) Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Locat ion The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-13 Figure 1. Example of public property: sidewalk, street, sidewalk. In this illustration, the colleges public property consists of the public sidewalk, street, and opposite sidewalk along all four borders of the campus. Nothing beyond the second sidewalk is included in the colleges public property. Private homes and businesses are not included: Public property does not include any businesses or any private homes (i.e., businesses or homes not owned or controlled by your institution) even if they immediately border your campus. This means that your public property does not include Joes Coffee House even if its located right next to your campus and many of your students hang out there every day . Nor does it include a privately owned house next to your campus that some of your students rent. Public Parking: If there is a public or municipal parking facility or lot bordering your campus, it is part of your public property. If the pa rking facility or lot that borders your campus is owned by an individual or a business, it is not. Your public property does not include a public parking facility or lot on the other side of the street across from your campus. Chapter 2.

Your public property does not include a public parking facility or lot on the other side of the street across from your campus. Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-14 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Figure 2. Example of public property: parking lot. In this illustration, Public Parking Lot A is included in the colleges public property category because its immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. Public Parking Lot B is not included in the colleges public property category because its not immediately adjacent to the campus. A sidewalk, street and sidewalk separate it from the campus. Public property associated with campuses in malls or office buildings: If your campus is within a mall or office building and you step outside onto a public sidewalk, include the sidewalk in your public property. If your agreement includes use of the mall or office building parking lot, the lot is part of your on-campus geography because under the Clery Act , the contract is treated as giving you control of the lot. If there is a public street running adjacent to the parking lot, thats your public property. If your agreement does not include use of the parking lot owned by the mall or office building, do not include the parking lot in your on-campus or your public property category. It is a private parking lot. If there is a public parking lot bordering the mall or office building (i.e., a parking lot Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-15 owned by a public entity), include it in your public property. If you lease a section of the lot, you are in control of that section and that section is part of your on- campus geography. If your lease allows you to park anywhere in the lot along with all of the other tenants, include the entire lot in your on-campus geography. Public parks: If there is a public park or similar type of public area immediately ad jacent to your campus, we recommend that you extend the reporting area one mile into the portion of the property that borders your campus. We consider this to be a reasonable walking distance from the campus. However, if the portion of the park adjacent to your campus is fenced in or otherwise inaccessible from your campus, it is not your public property. If the park is gated on the portion that borders your campus, and the gate is open at specific times, the park is your public property at the times it is accessible from your campus. If the public park is on the opposite side of the street from your campus, do not include it in your public property category.

If the public park is on the opposite side of the street from your campus, do not include it in your public property category. Public waterways: If the public property that is immediately adjacent to your campus is a public waterway, it should be treated the same as a park. We suggest that you extend the reporting area one mile into the area of the river, lake, ocean, etc., that borders your campus. However, if the portion of the waterway adjacent to your campus is inaccessible from your campus, it is not your public property. If the waterway is accessible at specific times, it is your public property at the times it is accessible from your campus. Public transit stops: A public transit stop (e.g., subway or metro station, trolley or bus stop) located on your campus or immediately adjacent to your campus is included in your public property category up to the point at which a rider is required to pay a fare. For a subway or metro station, your public property would end at the fare gates. For a trolley or bus stop, it would end when someone gets on the vehicle. Apply this guidance to all other types of transit stops as well. (If your institution has a campus police or security department whose patrol Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-16 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting jurisdiction extends beyond the point where a fare is required, crimes reported there would be included in your daily crime log. An example is campus police who patrol the waiting platform of a commuter tra in station. More about the crime log in Chapter 5.) Public buildings: Buildings or property belonging to a public college or university are not considered public property under the Clery Act . Nor are buildings that are open to the public in private institutions. Do not include the inside of a public building such as a public high school or public library in your public property category. Some state institutions have charters specifying that state-owned roads running through the campus are under the control of the campus. Such roads are on-campus roads, not public property. Institutions that share a campus: If you share an entire campus with another Title IV institution, both institutions have the same public property. No public property: Its possible that your campus does not have any public property.

Geography: Location, Location, Location The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-17 A campus entirely surrounded by a gated fence that restricts access (e.g., it is opened only by a guard or some type of pass). However, if the gate remains open for a specific period of time, and the gate opens onto a public road, the portion of the road along the gated side of the campus is public property during the times the gate is open. (Do not limit this public property to the area immediately in front of the gate.) Figure 3. Example of public property: gated fence. In this illustration, the college is bordered by a fence on all sides. When the gate is open, the colleges public property consists of the public sidewalk, street and opposite sidewalk that border the gated side of the campus. Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-18 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Before Moving On It is important that all Title IV institutions use the same geographic parameters when disclosing statistics in the annual security report and reporting those statistics to the Department. However, we are aware that some institutions want to report statistics for public property that is near their campus but outside the public property definition for Clery Act purposes. In those cases , the institution may include statistics for those areas in a caveat or table that is clearly separate from the official Clery Act statistics. How to Identify Your Noncampus Buildings or Property Noncampus definition citation 34 CFR 668.46( a) Does your institution own or control any buildings or property located off campus, in another city or even in another country? Does it have any officially recognized student organizations? If so, you may have what the Clery Act refers to as noncampus buildings or property. The noncampus category encompasses two distinct types of buildings and property: those owned or controlled by officially recognized (or registered) student organizations, and those located off campus but owned or controlled by your institution. The Clery Act definition of noncampus buildings or property is: Any building or property owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the institution; or any building or property owned or controlled by an institution that is used in direct support of, or in relation to, the institutions educational purposes, is frequently used by students, and is not within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area of the institution. The first part of the definition applies to any building or property that is owned or controlled by a student organization if the organization", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 22, "word_count": 500}
{"chunk_id": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf_chunk_23", "text": "or in relation to, the institutions educational purposes, is frequently used by students, and is not within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area of the institution. The first part of the definition applies to any building or property that is owned or controlled by a student organization if the organization is officially recognized by or registered with your institution. If its owned or controlled by the student organization, its considered noncampus under the Clery Act . There is one exception to this rule. If a fraternity or sorority house is located within the confines of the campus on land that is owned by the institution, the building is considered to be on Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-19 campus even if the building is owned or contr olled by the fraternity or sorority. The second part of the definition applies to additional locations that are associated with the campus but are not separate campuses. For example, you might lease a municipal athletic field for your teams home soccer g ames or you might rent classroom space in a local high school two nights a week to hold creative writing classes for your students. Perhaps your institution owns an apartment building a few miles from the campus that you use for student housing. These loca tions are examples of what the Clery Act calls noncampus buildings and properties, and because your institution owns or controls them, you must disclose statistics for reported crimes that occur there. These are some of the more common types of noncampus locations, but you should include any location (except a separate campus) that is owned or controlled by the institution; supports or is used for the institutions educational purposes; is frequently used by students; and is not considered part of the cor e campus. Because an institution may rent, lease or otherwise control a location for varying amounts of time, we suggest that you give someone at your institution responsibility for monitoring the status of all buildings and properties for which you have a written agreement to use. If your institution rents a classroom location only for a semester, the following semester that location would no longer be included in your noncampus category. If you rent a location for classes, but later use the same rented location onl y as offices for your payroll personnel, and it is no longer frequently used by students, it would cease to be a noncampus location. Regardless of the time period involved (e.g., a month, a semester or an entire calendar year), you must disclose Clery Act statistics for the days and times that your institution owns or controls any buildings or property that meet the noncampus definition.

Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-20 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Other Noncampus Considerations Noncampus loc ations do not have a public property reporting requirement : Although you must disclose Clery Act statistics for public property that is within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from your campus, you are not required to do so for public property within or adjacent to noncampus buildings or property. There is a difference between owning and controlling a noncampus building or property : If your institution owns a noncampus building or property you must disclose statistics for crimes that occur there at any time. If you do not own the location, under the Clery Act you have to disclose statistics only for crimes that occur when your institution has control of the space, that is, for the dates and times specified in your lease, rental or other agreement. Additionally, if your agreement is for a section of a building or property, for example the third floor of an office building, you have to disclose statistics only for the third floor, plus any other areas of the building that your students or employees must use to access the contracted space. So, suppose you have an agreement for the third floor of a building for Sept. 1 through Nov. 30, Monday through Thursday, 7 a.m. to 12 p.m. You must include statistics for Clery Act crimes that occur Sept. 1 through Nov. 30, Monday through Thursday, 7 a.m. to 12 p.m. on the third floor, the stairwell and elevators, the main lobby if its used to access the stairwell and elevators, etc. If your contract includes the use of the parking lot, include any crimes that occur in the lot. Note that if your agreement specifies 7 a.m. to 12 p.m., you must disclose statistics for that time period even if your students and employees occupy the space only for part of that time, for example, from 8 to 11:30 a.m. Limits of control : Suppose your institution rents one half of a buildingfor example, a public high schoolfor specific days and times in order to offer some classes but not an organized program of study. The rented section of the high school falls under the noncampus category for the dates and times it is rented, regardless of whether the institution rents it once or more than once.

This is true even if the crime involved one of your students. Space versus program agreements: Perhaps your institution sends students to an off-campus site for internships, externships, clinical training or student teaching. If you own or control the site or any space within the site, include the site or the specified space in your noncampus category. If you do not own or control the space, dont include it. If you have an agreement, even a written agreement, to send your students to a location for one of the aforementioned reasons, but that written agreement is for the program rather than for use of the physical space , you do not have control of the location and do not have to include statistics for crimes that occur there. For example, if you have a written agreement to send students to a privately owned hospital for clinical training, but you dont have a written agreement for use of the hospital or any space within the hospital, you do not have to include statistics for crimes that occur there. However, if you rent classroom space for your students within the same hospital, you are required to include crime statistics for that space, as well as for any other areas, such as a lobby or hallways and elevators used to access that space for the period of time specified in the agreement. Corporate offices: Include corporate offices that are owned or controlled by your institution and are not reasonably contiguous to your campus in the noncampus category if they are frequented by your students for any reason, including student jobs or internships. Prisons: If your institution sends faculty to a prison to teach, do not include the prison in your Clery Act statistics as you do not own or control it. Military bases: If you have a written agreement, such as a memorandum of understanding, giving you control over some part of a military base, include the Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-22 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting space in your noncampus category . Include statistics for crimes that occur in that space for the days and times specified in the agreement.

Institutions with shared campuses: If your institution shares a campus with another institution that has noncampus buildings or property, you are not required to including crime statistics for those noncampus buildings or properties unless you have a written agreement to use them as well. A noncampus location that becomes a separate campus: Its possible for a location to be noncampus for a period of time and t hen become a separate campus. For example, suppose your institution rents a few rooms in a building where your students take one or two writing classes. This is a noncampus location. A year and a half later its become a very popular location and you decid e to rent additional space there and offer a certificate program in technical writing. You hire a program director and administrative assistant to work there. Now the location offers an organized program of study and has administrative personnel on- site. Its a separate campus and must comply with all of the applicable requirements under the HEA. If the situation changes and the location is once again used only for a class or two, it reverts back to being a noncampus location. If a location meets the criteria for a separate campus at any point during a calendar year, it should be treated as a separate campus for that full year. Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-23 Off-Campus Student Housing Considerations Third-party contracts: If there is an apartment building across town from your campus thats owned by a third party that has a written agreement with your institution to provide student housing, it is a noncampus location. Some examples of this type of arrangement are a hotel, apartment building or student housing facility on another campus used for overflow housing. The hotel rooms, apartments or housing facilities and associated common areas specified in your written agreement are considered noncampus property. It doesnt matter whether the rent is paid to the third party by your institution on behalf of the students or paid directly by the students. If multiple institutions contract with the apartment building owner to provide student housing, you still must report crime statistics for the property based on the details of your agreement. This means that if your agreement is limited to apartments on the north wing of the first floor, include statistics for the apartments on that wing plus any common areas, such as the laundry room and the lobby, and the hallway used to access the apartments. If your agreement doesnt specify which apartments are reserved for use by your institutions students, you must include statistics for the entire building except for the interior of the apartments", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 26, "word_count": 500}

If your agreement doesnt specify which apartments are reserved for use by your institutions students, you must include statistics for the entire building except for the interior of the apartments that are used by another schools students. Institution -owned apartments and management companies: If your school owns an off- campus apartment building and puts a management company or a leasing agent in charge, but doesnt use the building for student housing or direct students to live there, do not include the building in your noncampus category even if some of your students happen to rent apartments there. The building doesnt support the institutions educational purposes. Mixed-use apartment buildings: If your school owns or controls an off-campus apartment building and reserves certain apartments or floors of apartments for student housing, the areas used for that housing, as well as common areas and areas used to access the student housing, are included in your noncampus category. Include any unoccupied Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-24 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting apartments that are specifically reserved for student housing. Do not include the apartments or floors of apartments that are not reserved for student housing. Do not include floors or apartments that are reserved for your faculty or staff. Figure 4. Example of noncampus location: mixed-use apartment building. In this illustration, the college leases the second floor of an off-campus apartment building to house students. The college must disclose statistics in the noncampus category for crimes reported to have occu rred on the second floor, the lobby and the stairs and elevator that students use to access the second floor. Preferred leasing: If you steer students toward recommended off -campus housing, but the housing is not owned or controlled by your institution (e.g., there is no written agreement between the third party and your institution to provide student housing, no residential life staff are located in the building, the building does not follow the institutions student housing policies), you arent required to include statistics for crimes that occur there. Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-25 Considerations for Trips to Off-Campus Locations Field trips: You are not required to include statistics for crimes that occur on field tr ips at locations your institution does not own or control. Overnight, school- sponsored trips: If your institution sponsors students on an overnight trip, for example to see a play, and they rent motel rooms, you dont have to include crimes that occur in those rooms in your Clery Act statistics because the motel rooms dont meet the frequently- used-by-students criterion. Repeated use of a location for school- sponsored trips: If your institution sponsors students on an overnight trip every year and the students stay in the same hotel each year, you must include portions of the hotel in your noncampus geography.

Repeated use of a location for school- sponsored trips: If your institution sponsors students on an overnight trip every year and the students stay in the same hotel each year, you must include portions of the hotel in your noncampus geography. For example, students in the debate club take a trip to Washington, D.C. and stay at the same hotel every year. You must include in your statistics any crimes that occur in the rooms used by your students and any common areas used to access the rooms (lobby, elevators, etc.) for the times and dates specified in the rental agreement. Note that what matters here is repeated use of a location that is owned or controlled by the institution, not the number of days it is used or whether it is used by the same students or different students. Short-stay away trips: If your institution sponsors short-stay away trips of more than one night for its students, all locations used by students during the trip, controlled by the institution during the trip and used to support educational purposes should be treated as noncampus property. An example is a three-week marine biology study trip to Florida. Any classroom or housing space specified in the agreement between the institution and a third- party providing the space would be noncampus property. If your institution has entered into a written agreement with a third -party contractor to arrange housing andor classroom space for a school-sponsored trip or study program (either domestic or foreign), it is assumed that the contractor is operating on behalf of Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location 2-26 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting the school as the schools agent, putting the institution in control of this space. However, if your institution (or a contracted third party) does not have an agreement for the space used, your institution is not in control of the space and you are not required to count it. For example, there are some situations, such as sports tournaments, for which the host institution makes all of the housing arrangements for visiting students. In these situations, the visiting institutions do not have a written agreement for the use of space and are not required to disclose crime statistics for the housing in which their students are located. However, the host institution would be responsible for disclosing crime statistics for the housing since they hold the agreement for the housing. Study abroad programs: If your institution sends students to study abroad at a location or faci lity that you dont own or control, you dont have to include statistics for crimes that occur in those facilities. However, if your institution rents or leases space for your students in a hotel or student housing facility, you are in control of that spac e for the time period covered by your agreement.

Use of Maps Although the Clery Act does not require institutions to provide a map to show their campus and noncampus buildings, or property or public property areas, some institutions choose to provide one in their annual security report to help the campus community better understand where reported crimes occurred. A map is also useful if your institution is subject to a program review to help identify the buildings and property that make up your institutions Clery Act geography, and to pinpoint the patrol jurisdiction of your campus police or security personnel, if you have any. If you use a map it must present an accurate picture of the geographic locations it depicts, and you should update it as necessary. If you have Chapter 2. Geography: Location, Location, Location The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2-27 several campuses and choose to provide maps, you must have a separate map for each campus. When in Doubt Remember that keeping track of the buildings and properties your institution owns and controls, and what they are used for, is an institutional responsibility. If you are still unsure how to ident ify your Clery Act geography or if you have a unique situation that isnt covered here, help is always available.

The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-1 Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes CHAPTER 3 Consider the following scenarios: A student enters three unlocked rooms in an on-campus student housing facility and takes several items from two of them. Campus security breaks up a party in a noncampus student housing facility and six students get referred for disciplinary action for possession of marijuana. A school employee calls the police to report spray- painted racial slurs on the side of an on-campus dining hall. A student seems to show up at every activity attended by his ex-girlfriend and sends her several suggestive emails . Are these incidents Clery Act crimes? Must you include them in the crime statistics in your annual security report and the Web-based data collection? Should you count crimes in dorm rooms the same way you count crimes in academic offices? Whats the difference between Burglary and Larceny?

Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-2 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting The Clery Act requires your institution to include four general categories of crime statistics: Reported crime statistics citation 34 CFR 668.46(c) Crim inal Offenses1Criminal Homicide, including Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter, and Manslaughter by Negligence; Sexual Assault ,2 including Rape, Fondling, Incest and Statutory Rape; Robbery; Aggravated Assault; Burglary; Motor Vehicle Theft; and Arson. Hate Crimes Any of the above-mentioned offenses, and any incidents of Larceny- Theft, Simple Assault, Intimidation, or Destruction Damage Vandalism of Property that were motivated by bias; VAWA Offenses Any incidents of D omestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking. (Note that Sexual Assault is also a VAWA Offense but is included in the Criminal Offenses category for Clery Act reporting purposes); and Arrests and Referrals for Disciplinary Action for WeaponsCarrying, Possessing, Etc. L aw Violations, Drug Abuse Violations and Liquor Law Violations. Statistics must be disclosed separately for each of these four general categories. This means that when an incident meets definitions in more than one of these categories, it must be reported in each category. For example, any Criminal Offense that is also a Hate Crime or VAWA Offense, or results in an arrest or disciplinary action for a Weapons, D rug Abuse or Liquor Law Violation, should be counted as a Criminal Offense and also as a Hate Crime, VAWA Offense, arrest, or disciplinary referral, as appropriate. The Hierarchy Rule discussed on pages 3-24 and 3-25 applies only when counting crimes within the Criminal Offenses category. Note: Whenever Clery Act crimes or crimes are mentioned in this handbook, all of the categories above are included. 1 Also referred to as Primary Crimes. 2 Also referred to as Sex Offenses.

Note that, although the law states that institutions must use the UCR Program definitions, Clery Act crime reporting does not have to meet all of the other UCR Program standards. Violence Against Women Act of 1994 definitions cit ation 34 CFR 668.46(c)( 6)(A)(i) For the categories of D omestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking , the Clery Act specifies that you must use the definitions provided by the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and repeated in the Departments Clery Act regulations. It is possible that institutions may be asked to code incidents using different definitions for purposes other than Clery Act reporting. However, for Clery Act purposes, it is essential that institutions classify and count reported incidents based on the definitions specified by the Clery Act . In this chapter, crime definitions appear in italics. Some of the text that is provided to help you classify criminal incidents is taken directly from FBI materials or federal statutes and some has been condensed or paraphrased. Some crime examples are taken or adapted from FBI materials, and others were created for this handbook based on questions schools and practitioners have asked us over the years. You must include in your crime statistics the number of all reported offenses , without regard to the findings of a court, coroner or jury, or the decision of a prosecutor. Classify and count crimes from the records of calls for service, complaints and investigations. More information on how to collect these statistics is found in Chapter 4.

Include one incident of on-campus Murder and Non- negligent Manslaughter in your crime statistics. Scenario 3: A husband and wife have an argument at a married student housing facility owned by the institution that is five miles from campus, and the wife shoots and kills her husband. Include one incident of noncampus Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter in your crime statistics. Also include one incident of noncampus Domestic Violence. (Domestic Violence is discussed on pages 3-37 and 3-38.) Scenario 4: A nonstudent is shot and killed during an armed Robbery on a city -owned sidewalk in front of a building on campus. Include one incident of public property Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter in your crime statistics. Scenario 5: Two students get into an argument at a popular off-campus bar. Bob attacks Brad with a broken bottle and Brad pulls out a gun and kills Bob. Do not include this incident in your Clery Act statistics because the incident occurred at a private facility off campus. b) Manslaughter by Negligence is defined as the killing of another person through gross negligence . Count one offense per victim. Include as Manslaughter by Negligence: Any death caused by the gross negligence of another. In other words, its something that a reasonable and prudent person would not do. Do not include as Manslaughter by Negligence: Deaths of persons due to their own negligence. Accidental deaths not resulting from gross negligence. Traffic fatalities. Remember that the findings of a co urt, coroners inquest, etc., do not affect classifying or counting criminal incidents.

Include attempted S exual Assaults, but do not include in your Clery Act statistics any Sexual Assaults other than the four types of Sexual Assaults described in this chapter. a) Rape is the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus, with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. This offense includes the rape of both males and females. Count one offense per victim. Include the crime as Rape, regardless of the age of the victim, if the victim did not consent or if the victim was incapable of giving consent. If the victim consented, the offender did not force or threaten the victim, and the victim was under the statutory age of consent, include the crime as S tatutory Rape. b) Fondling is the touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the conse nt of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of hisher age or because of hisher temporary or permanent mental incapacity. Count one offense per victim. Fondling is recognized as an element of the other sex offenses. Therefore, count Fondling only if it is the only sex offense. c) Incest is sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law. Count one offense per victim. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-7 d) Statutory Rape is sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent . Count one offense per victim. The statutory age of consent differs by state and can get complicated. For example, in Maryland, the statutory age of consent is 16 years of age (which means the victim must be under 16); however, 14- and 15- year-olds may consent if the offender is less than four years older than the victim. In Nevada, the age of consent is 16; however, sexual intercourse with someone who is under 16 years of age is illegal only if the defendant is at least 18 years of age (the age at which", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 33, "word_count": 500}

In Nevada, the age of consent is 16; however, sexual intercourse with someone who is under 16 years of age is illegal only if the defendant is at least 18 years of age (the age at which the defendant can be prosecuted). We recommend that you consult your states statutes to determine the statutory age of consent. Remember, if force was used or threatened, or the victim was incapable of giving consent because of hisher age or temporary or permanent mental impairment, the offense is R ape, not S tatutory Rape. The ability of the victim to give consent must be a professional determination by a law enforcement agency. Note that, while the definitions of Sexual Assault include lack of consent as an element of the offense, for the purposes of including a reported S exual Assault in Clery Act statistics, no determination as to whether that element has been met is required. Therefore, all Sexual Assaults that are reported to a campus security authority must be included in your Clery Act statistics and also included in your crime log (if you are required to have one), regardless of the issue of consent. All Sexual Assaults that are reported to a campus security authority must be included in your Clery Act statistics , regardless of the issue of consent . Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-8 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Examples of Sexual Assault Scenario 1: A female student reports that she was raped by an unidentified male while jogging along a campus trail. Include this as one on- campus Rape. Scenario 2: A female student reports that her ex -boyfriend had sex with her in her campus residence hall room while she was unconscious after a night of drinking alcohol. Include this as one Rape in the on- campus catego ry and one Rape in the on-campus student housing facility category. Also include one incident of Dating Violence in both the on-campus and on-campus student housing facility categories (Dating Violence is discussed on pages 3-36 and 3-37). Scenario 3: A male student reports that another male student fondled him in a campus building while telling him that he was glad they could finally be alone. Include this as one on-campus Fondling. Scenario 4: A female student reports to the campus police that she was raped in her car in a parking lot on her schools campus by students from another college. Include this as one on-campus Rape. Scenario 5: Three female students report that they were each raped by five male students at an off-campus fraternity house owned by a recognized fraternity. Each male raped each of the female students. Include this as three noncampus Rapes.

Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-9 3. Robbery. Robbery is the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence andor by putting the victim in fear. In any instance of Robbery, count one offense for each dist inct operation (i.e., incident), including attempts. Do not count the number of victims robbed, the number of those present at the Robbery or the number of offenders. Essential Elements of a Robbery: Committed in the presence of a victim (usually the owner or person having custody of the property). Victim is directly confronted by the perpetrator. Victim is threatened with force or put in fear that force will be used. Involves a T heft or Larceny. Because some type of assault is an element of Robbery, do not report an assault as a separate crime as long as it was performed in furtherance of the Robbery. However, if the injury results in death, classify the incident as Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter. Aids to Classifying Incidents as Robberies The classification of Robbery includes both a rmed robbery and robberies where only personal weapons are used. Armed robbery includes incidents commonly referred to as stickups, hijackings, holdups, heists, carjackings, etc. Carjacking is a Robbery offense in which a motor vehicle is taken", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 35, "word_count": 500}

Aids to Classifying Incidents as Robberies The classification of Robbery includes both a rmed robbery and robberies where only personal weapons are used. Armed robbery includes incidents commonly referred to as stickups, hijackings, holdups, heists, carjackings, etc. Carjacking is a Robbery offense in which a motor vehicle is taken through force or threat of force. In such case, following the Hierarchy Rule, report only a Robbery, not a Motor Vehicle Theft. (The Hierarchy Rule is discussed on pages 3-24 and 3-25). Robberies in which only personal weapons, such as hands, arms, fists, feet and teeth, are used or threatened to be used may be referred to as strong-arms or muggings. The UCR considers a weapon to be a commonly known weapon (a gun, knife, club, etc.) or any other item that, although not usually thought of as a weapon, becomes one in the commission of a crime. Robbery also includes crimes involving pretend weapons or those in which the weapon is not seen by the victim, but the robber claims to possess one. Remember, the use or threat of force is an essential element of Robbery. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-10 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Remember, the use or threat of force is an essential element of Robbery. For example, pocket -picking or purse- snatching where force is neither used nor threatened is Larceny-Theft. However, if force or threat of force is used to overcome the active resistance of the victim in a purse-snatching or other such crime, include the offense as Robbery. Example of Robbery Scenario: Two students returning to campus from a night at a local bar are approached by three armed men on a city sidewalk outside their residence hall and told to hand over their wallets. The students comply, and the three armed men leave without harming the students. Include this as one Robbery on public property. 4. Aggravated Assault. Aggravated A ssault is an unlawful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. This type of assault usually is accompanied by the use of a weapon or by means likely to produce death or great bodily harm. Count one offense per victim. However, if a number of persons are involved in a dispute or disturbance, and the aggressors cannot be distinguished from the victims, count the number of persons assaulted as the number of offenses. Include as Aggravated Assaults: Assaults or attempts to kill or Murder. Poisoning (including the use of date rape drugs). Assault with a dangerous or deadly weapon. Maiming. Mayhem. Assault with explosives. Assault with disease (as in cases when the offender is aware that he or she is infected with a deadly disease and deliberately attempts to inflict the disease by biting, spitting, etc.). Count all assaults by one person upon another with the intent to kill, maim or inflict severe bodily injury with the use of any dangerous weapon. It is", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 36, "word_count": 500}

Count all assaults by one person upon another with the intent to kill, maim or inflict severe bodily injury with the use of any dangerous weapon. It is not necess ary that injury result from an A ggravated Assault when a gun, knife or other weapon Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-11 that could cause serious personal injury is used. Also count attacks using per sonal weapons, such as hands, arms, feet, fists and teeth that result in serious or aggravated injury. In making determinations about whether or not an assault that is carried out using a body part such as hands and feet is aggravated, the institution must consider not only the intent of the attacker but also the extent of the injuries. If an attack results in broken bones, a loss of consciousness or significant blood loss, or requires medical treatment or hospitalization, such as stitches or casting (regar dless of whether or not the victim accepts such assistance), the incident must be classified as an A ggravated Assault. As stated earlier, the UCR considers a weapon to be a commonly known weapon (a gun, knife, club, etc.) or any other item that, although not usually thought of as a weapon, becomes one in the commission of a crime. For example, if an individual intentionally drives a car into another occupied car, classify the incident as an Aggravated Assault because, regardless of the extent of injury sus tained by the victim, the car was used as a weapon. If the victim dies, however, classify the death as Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter. The use of drugs to subdue a victim, such as the use of date rape drugs, should be counted as A ggravated Assault because it can be assumed that the intent was to inflict aggravated bodily harm. However, if the use of the drugs results in Rape or Murder within the same incident, follow the Hierarchy Rule, and count the more serious offenses. (The Hierarchy Rule is dis cussed on pages 3-24 and 3-25.) Be aware that assault cases might be categorized as assault and battery, disorderly conduct, domestic violence or simple assault by some local jurisdictions, even though a knife, gun or other weapon was used in the incident. These should be classified as Aggravated A ssault for Clery Act reporting purposes. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-12 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Aid for Classifying Assaults Carefully consider the following factors in classifying assaults: The type of weapon used or the use of an object as a weapon; The seriousness of the injury; and The intent of the assailant to cause serious injury.

The intent to cause death or severe bodily harm can arise after the parties to an incident have already engaged in some consensual contact. For example, consider a situation where friends are on opposite teams in an intermural basketball game or where roommates are wrestling in their dorm room. Aggressive but consensual horseplay can become a violent altercation. For example, where one of the players in the basketball game punches a member of the opposing team instead of defending the goal, rendering him unconscious, or one roommate wants to stop wrestling and the other applies a violent headlock, causing a serious neck injury. Both of these examples count as Aggravated Assault. Often, the weapon used or the extent of the injury sustained will be the deciding factor in distin guishing Aggravated from S imple Assault. Do not classify an incident as an Aggravated Assault based solely on prosecutorial policy in a jurisdiction. Examine and count assaults according to the standard UCR definitions, regardless of whether they are labeled misdemeanors or felonies by local definitions. Examine and count assaults according to the standard UCR definitions, regardless of whether they are labeled misdemeanors or felonies by local definitions . Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-13 Examples of Aggravated Assault Scenario 1: Sarah and Anne have a heated argument at a party at a sorority house owned by a recognized sorority located a mile from the campus. Sarah grabs a lacrosse stick and repeatedly beats Anne across the b ack with it, breaking several ribs. Include this as one Aggravated Assault in the noncampus category. Scenario 2: Two students are involved in a fist fight in the laundry room in their on- campus dormitory. Both sustain head injuries and are treated at a hospital. Include this as two Aggravated Assaults in the on-campus category and two Aggravated Assaults in the on- campus student housing facility category. Scenario 3: Brad and Tim are involved in a physical altercation in a campus parking lot behind their dormitory. Brad pulls a canister of Mace from his pocket and sprays Tim in the face, causing him severe burning and discomfort. Tim flees the scene and seeks medical attention. Include this as one on- campus Aggravated Assault. Scenario 4: Campus police resp ond to a disturbance call on a public sidewalk in back of the campus and find a fight in progress. Most of the participants escape except for four injured individuals. None of the individuals would cooperate and the campus police could not determine who started the fight. The four individuals suffered from severe knife wounds. Include this as four Aggravated Assaults on public property.

Scenario 5: A male student slips a date rape drug into a female students drink at a noncampus fraternity house. Before he can lure the victim away from her friends, however, someone notices what he had done and summons the police. Count this as one noncampus Aggravated Assault. 5. Burglary. Burglary is the unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or a theft. Count one offense per each distinct operation . It is imperative that institutions carefully evaluate the operative facts of each reported incident to determine if it fits into any subpart of this definition. Classify as Burglary: Offenses that are classified by local law enforcement agencies as Burgl ary (any degree); unlawful entry with intent to commit a larceny or felony; breaking and entering with intent to commit a larceny; housebreaking; safecracking; and all attempts at these offenses. Forcible Entry: All offenses where force of any kind is used to unlawfully enter a structure for the purpose of committing a theft or felony. This rule applies It is imperative that institutions carefully evaluate the operative facts of each reported incident to determine if it fits into any subpart of this definition. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-14 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting when a thief gains entry by using tools; breaking windows; forcing windows, doors, transoms or ventilators; cutting screens, walls or roofs; and where known, using master keys, picks, unauthorized keys, celluloid, a mechanical contrivance of any kind (e.g., a passkey or skeleton key) or other devices that leave no outward mark but are used to force a lock. This includes B urglary by concealment inside a building followed by exiting the structure. Unlawful Entry No Force: The entry of a structure in this situation is achieved by use of an unlocked door or window. The element of trespass to the structure is essential in this category, which includes thefts from open garages, open warehouses, open or unlocked dwellings (such as dorm rooms) and open or unlocked common basement areas in apartment houses where entry is achieved by someone other than the tenant who has lawful access, or others whom the tenant allows to have free and regular access to the structure. If an item was taken from an unlocked dorm room and you can establish that neither the tenant nor those friends with free and regular access to the room have taken the item, then unlawful access has occurred. In this context, it is important to note that a breaking occurs when a perpetrator crosses the threshold of a boundary that results in a trespass. As such it is possible for a burglar to break an open doorway or window. There is no requirement that entry be forced in any way or that damage", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 39, "word_count": 500}

As such it is possible for a burglar to break an open doorway or window. There is no requirement that entry be forced in any way or that damage to a door, window or frame be evident. Attempted Forcible Entry: A situation where a forcible entry into a locked structure is attempted but not completed. An attempt to commit the crime of Burglary must be evaluated in context based on all available information. Such incidents must not be classified merely as suspicious activity or vandalism where the totality of facts indicates that a Burglary was in fact attempted. Possible indicators of an attempted Burglary may include , but are not limited to, damage to a door or window, the presence of Burglary tools, a recurring or similar modus operandi or signature that ties an incident to other similar offenses (sometimes referred to as common Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-15 plan and scheme), andor proximity in time and place to a pattern of other similar crimes. Do not classify as Burglary: Thefts from automobiles, whether locked or not. Shoplifting from commercial establishments. Thefts from coin boxes or coin-operated machines. Thefts from areas of open access. If a perpetrator steals an item from an area of open access (i.e., there is no unlaw ful entry), the incident is a Larceny, not Burglary. For example, if a student leaves his backpack under the table in a campus dining hall and another student takes it, its a Larceny. However, if a student leaves his backpack under the table in a campus d ining hall and another student breaks into the building after hours and steals the backpack, its a Burglary. Robbery. A structure can be burglarized, but it cannot be robbed. It is possible, however, for an attempted Burglary to become a Robbery. For exa mple, a student returns to her dorm room and surprises a burglar. The burglar physically attacks the student, steals her purse and flees. Because the burglar attacked the student and took her property, include this incident as a Robbery. If the student had not been physically confronted by the burglar and merely observed the burglar leaving her room, the incident would be a Burglary, even if the burglar left empty-handed. A forcible entry or unlawful entry in which no theft or felony occurs, but acts of va ndalism, malicious mischief, etc., are committed, provided investigation clearly established that the unlawful entry was for a purpose other than to commit a felony or theft. An incident must meet three conditions to be classified as a Burglary: 1) There must be evidence of unlawful entry (trespass). This means that the person did not have the right to be in the structure at the time the incident occurred. If a perpetrator steals an item from an area", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 40, "word_count": 500}

Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-16 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Examples of lawful access include: A student uses her keycard to enter her dorm. She lets five other students who do not have keycards for that dorm into the building. All six of the students have lawful access to the building. A student has a party in her dorm room with four guests. All five students have lawful access to the dorm room. A faculty member has an office in the science building. Students are in and out of the office while the science building is open. Anyone from the campus community going in the office during this time has lawful access. Examples of unlawful access include: A student uses her keycard to enter a dorm. Without her knowing, a student without a keycard to the building walks in after her. The student without the keycard does not have lawful access to the building. A student has a party in her dorm room with four invited guests. When the party is over the host asks everyone to leave. She leaves the door unlocked while she goes to visit another student. One of the students who attended the party opens the door and takes some money off of the desk. That student does not have lawful access to the room. A faculty member has an office in the science building. One night when the science building is locked, a maintenance worker who does not have a work order for the building, uses a maintenance key to unlock the building and then unlock the faculty members door and steals a computer. The maintenance worker does not have lawful access to the office. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-17 2) The unlawful entry must occur within a structure, which is defined as having four walls, a roof, and a door. The UCR definition of a structure includes: Apartment, barn, cabin, church, condominium, dwelling house, factory, garage, house trailer or houseboat (if used as a permanent dwelling), mill, office, other building, outbuilding, public building, railroad car, room, school, stable, storage facility, vessel (ship) and warehouse. Any house trailer or other mobile unit that is permanently fixed as an office, residence or storehouse. The UCR definition of a structure does not include: Motor vehicles. Tents, tent trailers, motor homes, house trailers or other mobile units that are being used for recreational purposes. A telephone booth. A gym locker or cubby. 3) The structure was unlawfully entered", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 41, "word_count": 500}

A telephone booth. A gym locker or cubby. 3) The structure was unlawfully entered to commit a felony or a theft. If the intent was not to commit a felony or a theft, the incident is not a Burglary. For example, if a homeless student unlawfully entered a structure to sleep, do not include the incident as a Burglary. Special Rules for Counting Burglaries Burglaries in individual student rooms: Because residents of rooms in student housing facilities are not considered transient, the Burglary of each room is a separate offense. This means that if an offender unlawfully enters five dorm rooms on one floor of a student housing facility for the purpose of taking something, you should count this as five Burglaries. Burglaries in suites: Each bedroom in a student housing facility suite is considered a separate dwelling. Count the Burglary of four bedrooms and the common room in a suite during a single incident as five Burglaries. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-18 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Burglaries in private academic offices: Unlike a student housing facility in which each room is considered to be a separate dwelling, the various rooms within an academic building are typically under the control of a single firm (the college or university). Count the Burglary of an academic structure as one offense, regardless of the number of interior rooms entered or items stolen if the rooms were all burglarized during the same time frame. ( If, however, the rooms were burglarized within different time frames, for example one office on Monday and a second office the following day, count this as two Burglaries.) Burglaries in patient rooms in campus or noncampus medical centers: Because residen ts in patient rooms in hospitals or medical centers are transient, offenses are most likely to be reported to law enforcement by the institution. Count the Burglary of a number of patient rooms during the same time frame as a single offense. Examples of Burglary Scenario 1: A room in an on-campus dormitory is broken into and a laptop is stolen by a student living down the hall. Because the student unlawfully entered the room, include this as one on-campus Burglary and one on-campus student housing facility Burglary. Scenario 2: A student living in an on-campus dormitory invites another student into her room. The invited student takes a ring from the top of a dresser when the owner leaves to use the restroom. Because the perpetrator was invited into the room, there is no element of trespass. Do not include this incident in your Clery Act statistics because it is a Larceny. Scenario 3: A perpetrator enters five on -campus dorm rooms without permission on the same night looking to steal money.

Scenario 3: A perpetrator enters five on -campus dorm rooms without permission on the same night looking to steal money. He takes a wallet from one room, but takes nothing from the other four rooms. Include this as five Burglaries in both the on- campus category and on-campus student housing facility category. Scenario 4: Someone enters an unlocked dorm room on campus and steals a students wallet. Investigation determines that the students roommate did not take the wallet. Because no one else had lawful access to the dorm room at the time the wallet was taken, it had to have been taken by someone who did not have lawful access. Include this as one on-campus Burglary and one on-campus student housing facility Burglary. Scenario 5: A patient in a hospital room in an on- campus medical center reports a stolen watch. Police investigate and cannot determine who took the watch. Because there is no evidence that someone unlawfully entered the room to steal the watch, this is a Larceny. Do not include this incident in your Clery Act statistics. Chapter 3.

Scenario 7: A school is bordered by a parking garage that has four walls, a roof and a door. Anyone who pays can park there. Someone enters the garage and steals a GPS from a car. Because the garage has open access there was no element of tres pass. Do not include this incident in your Clery Act statistics because it is a Larceny.

Motor Vehicle Theft is the theft or attempted theft of a motor vehicle. Count one offense for each stolen vehicle. Classify as Motor Vehicle Theft: Theft of any self -propelled vehicle that runs on land surface and not on rails, such as sport utility vehicles, automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, motor scooters, trail bikes, mopeds, all- terrain vehicles, self-propelled motor homes, snowmobiles, gol f carts and motorized wheelchairs. All incidents where automobiles are taken by persons not having lawful access even though the vehicles are later abandoned. Include joyriding in this category. If a vehicle is stolen in conjunction with another offense, classify the crime using the procedures for classifying multiple offenses (i.e., the Hierarchy Rule, pages 3-24 and 3- 25). Do not classify as Motor Vehicle Theft: Theft of any of the following: Farm equipment, bulldozers, airplanes, construction equipment , water craft (motorboats, sailboats, houseboats or jet skis). Taking a vehicle for temporary use when prior authority has been granted or can be assumed, such as in family situations, rental car agreements, or unauthorized use by chauffeurs and others having lawful access to the vehicle. A forcible or unlawful entry of a building to steal a motor vehicle. Include this offense as a Burglary. Thefts from motor vehicles. Theft from a motor vehicle is Larceny, which is not a Clery Act crime unless its motivated by bias (i.e., a H ate Crime).

Arson is any willful or malicious burning or attempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house, public building, motor vehicle or aircraft, personal property of another, etc. Count one offense for each distinct incident of Arson occurring on your Clery Act geography. Classify as Arson: Only fires determined to have been willfully or maliciously set. Attempts to burn. Any fire that investigation determines to meet the UCR definition of Arson regardless of the value of any property damage. Incidents where an individual willfully or maliciously burns his or her own property. The Clery Act requires institutions to disclose all A rsons that occur on their Clery Act geography. This includes seemingly minor fires such as burni ng wastebaskets or bulletin boards, regardless of whether they are discovered while burning or after being extinguished. All of the evidence for any fire not known to be accidental (such as a cooking fire) must be considered by the institutional official designated to make such determinations. Some jurisdictions have specific rules that state that a fire is not to be classif ied as Arson unless and until a fire marshal makes a determination of malicious burning. The Clery Acts Arson definition does All of the evidence for any fire not known to be accidental (such as a cooking fire) must be considered by the institutional official designated to make such determinations .

Do not classify as Arson: Fires of susp icious origin. Fires of unknown origin. Cautions in D isclosing Arson statistics Point of origin: If a fire (determined to be Arson) starts in a privately owned house located next to your campus and spreads to a building on your campus, you are not required to include the fire in your A rson statistics because the point of origin for the Arson was not your Clery Act geography. If the situation is reversed, and an on- campus fire (determined to be Arson) spreads to the house, you must include the on-campus Arson in your Clery Act statistics.

If the private home and the on-campus building are burning, and investigators later determine that the cause was Arson, but the point of origin could not definitively be determined, your school is responsible for including the Arson in your statistics for the on- campus building. Count incidents in which persons are killed as a direct result of Arson as both Criminal Homicides and Arson. Similarly, report the number of persons severely injured during an Arson as Aggravated Assaults along with the Arson. When other reportable offenses are committed during the same distinct operation as the Arson offense, report the most serious offense along with the Arson. (More about the Hierarchy Rule on pages 3-24 and 3-25.) An important note for institutions that have on- campus student housing facilities: Arsons in on-campus student housing facilities must also be included in your fire statistics. This means that in Scenario 5, for example, you must also include the incident as one intentional fire in the on -campus Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying a nd Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-23 student housing facility in which the fire occurred.

Examples of Arson Scenario 1: A student is killed by what an investigation determines was a deliberately set fire in his campus residence hall room. Include this as one Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter and one Arson in the on-campus category and one Murder and Non- negligent Manslaughter and one Arson in the on-campus student housing facility category. Scenario 2: A suspicious fire is reported in a campus academic building, but fire authorities cannot determine if it was intentionally set. Do not include this incident as Arson in y our Clery Act statistics. Scenario 3: A resident of a noncampus Greek house sets fire to his couch on the lawn in front of the house in celebration of a school football victory. Investigators determine that the incident was Arson. Include this as one Arson in the noncampus category. Scenario 4: A fire is reported in a campus dormitory. Ten students are killed as a direct result of the flames and asphyxiation. Two more students die from internal injuries when they attempt to jump to safety. Six people are hospitalized with second- and third- degree burns. Investigation determines that the fire was intentional. Include this as one Arson in the on-campus category and the on-campus student housing facility category and 12 Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughters and six Aggravated Assaults in the on- campus category and the on-campus student housing facility category.

Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-24 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Beyond the BasicsAdditional Rules for Counting and Disclosing Crimes Hierarchy rule citation 34 CFR 668.46(c)(9) The Hierarchy Rule When counting multiple offenses, you must use the FBIs UCR Hierarchy Rule. Under this rule, when more than one Criminal Offense was committed during a single incident you should only count the most serious offense . A single incident means that the offenses were committed at the same time and place. That is, the time interval between the offenses and the distance between the locations where they occurred were insignificant. Beginning with the most serious offense, the following list shows the hierarchy for Clery Act reporting: Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter Manslaughter by Negligence Sexual Assault Robbery Aggravated Assault Burglary Motor Vehicle Theft An example based on the H ierarchy Rule might be if a student is both raped and robbed during a single incident. In this case, include only the R ape in the statistics, because it is classified as the more serious crime in the hierarchy. There are exceptions to using the Hierarchy Rule when counting offenses. They apply to Arson, Sexual Assaults, Hate Crimes and VAWA Offenses. Arson and Sexual Assaults are defined above and the rules for counting them are discussed here. (See pages 3 -25 through 3- 35 in the Hate Crime section for the rules for counting Hate Crimes. See page 3 -42 in the VAWA Offenses section for the rules for counting VAWA Offenses.) There are exceptions to using the Hierarchy Rule when counting Arson, Sexual Assaults and Hate Crimes . Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying a nd Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-25 The rules for counting Arson are: Always count Arson regardless of the nature of any other offenses that were committed during the same incident. When multiple offenses are committed during the same distinct operation as the Arson offense, report the most serious offense along with the Arson. Include incidents in which persons are killed as a direct result of Arson as Murder and Non- negligent Manslaughter and Arson or Manslaughter by Negligence and Arson. The rules for counting Sexual Assaults are: If Rape, Fondling, Incest or Statutory Rape occurs in the same incident as Murder, count both the sexual assault and the Murder. Fondling is recognized as an element of the other Sexual Assaults. Include a Sexual Assault", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 47, "word_count": 500}

If Fondling occurs in the same incident as Murder, count both the Fondling and the Murder. Hate Crimes Hate crime citation 34 CFR 668.46(c)(4) The second category of statistics you must disclose after Criminal Offenses is Hate Crimes. A Hate Crime is a criminal offense that manifests evidence that the victim was intentionally selected because of the perpetrators bias against the victim. Although there are many possible categories of bias, under the Clery Act , only the following eight categories are reported: Race. A preformed negative attitude toward a group of persons who possess common physical characteristics, e.g., color of skin, eyes, andor hair; facial features, etc., genetically transmitted by descent and heredity which distinguish them as a distinct divisio n of humankind, e.g., Asians, blacks or African Americans, whites. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-26 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Religion. A preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a group of persons who share the same religious beliefs regarding the origin and purpose of the universe and the existence o r nonexistence of a supreme being, e.g., Catholics, Jews, Protestants, atheists. Sexual Orientation. A preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a group of persons based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation. Sexual Orientation is the term f or a persons physical, romantic, andor emotional attraction to members of the same andor opposite sex, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual (straight) individuals. Gender. A preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a person or group of persons based on their actual or perceived gender, e.g., male or female. Gender Identity. A preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a person or group of persons based on their actual or perceived gender identity, e.g., bias against transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. Gender non-conforming describes a person who does not conform to the gender- based expectations of society, e.g., a woman dressed in traditionally male clothing or a man wearing makeup. A gender non-conforming person may or may not be a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender person but may be perceived as such. Ethnicity. A preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a group of people whose members identify with each other, through a common heritage, often consisting of a common language, common culture (often including a shared religion) andor ideology that stresses common ancestry. The concept of ethnicity differs from the closely related term race in that race refers to a grouping based mostly upon biological criteria, while ethnicity also encompasses additional cultural factors. National Origin.

This bias may be against people that have a name or accent associated with a national origin group, participate in Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying a nd Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-27 certain customs associated with a national origin group, or because they are married to or associate with people of a certain national origin. Disability. A preformed negative opinion or attit ude toward a group of persons based on their physical or mental impairments, whether such disability is temporary or permanent, congenital or acquired by heredity, accident, injury, advanced age or illness. For Clery Act purposes, H ate Crimes include any of the following offenses that are motivated by bias. Murder and Non- negligent Manslaughter Sexual Assault Robbery Aggravated A ssault Burglary Motor Vehicle Theft Arson Larceny-Theft Simple Assault Intimidation DestructionD amageVandalism of Property The first seven offenses are defined and discussed in the Criminal Offenses section earlier in this chapter. In addition to those offenses, L arceny-Theft, Simple Assault, Intimidation, and Destruction DamageVandalism of P roperty are included in your Clery Act statistics only if they are Hate Crimes. 1. Larceny-Theft is the unlawful taking, carrying, leading or riding away of property from the possession or constructive possession of another. (Larceny and theft mean the same thing in the UCR.) Constructive pos session is the condition in which a person does not have physical custody or possession, Larceny-Theft, Simple Assault, Intimidation, and Destruction Damage Vandalism of property are included in your Clery Act statistics only if they are Hate Crimes.

Classify as Larceny: Thefts of bicycles or automobile accessories. Shoplifting. Pocket-picking. The stealing of any property or article that is not taken by force and violence or by fraud. Any of the above regardless of the value of the item or items taken (For example, include the unlawful taking of a parking sticker that is peeled off a car windshield.) Attempted larcenies. Do not classify as Larceny: Motor Vehicle Theft. Attempted Motor Vehicle Theft. Embezzlement. Confidence games. Forgery. Worthless checks. 2. Simple Assault is an unlawful physical attack by one person upon another where neither the offender displays a weapon, nor the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, severe laceration, or loss of consciousness.

Crime Statistics: Classifying a nd Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-29 3. Intimidation is to unlawfully place another person in reasonable fear of bodily harm through the use of threatening words andor other conduct, but without displaying a weapon or subjecting the victim to actual physical attack. A person is assumed to be placed in reasonable fear if he or she reports threatening words or other conduct to law enforcement personnel. To be the victim of Intimidation, one doesnt have to be the intended target of the offender. For example, a person who reports seeing anti-gay threats on a bathroom wall to law enforcement is considered a victim. (For the Intimidation to be considere d a Hate Crime there would have to be other supporting evidence of bias as well.) Include in this category cyber -intimidation if the victim is threatened via electronic means while on your Clery Act geography. 4. DestructionDamageVandalism of Property is to willfully or maliciously destroy, damage, deface, or otherwise injure real or personal property without the consent of the owner or the person having custody or control of it. Classify as DestructionDamageVandalism of Property a wide range of malicious behavior directed at property, such as: Cutting auto tires. Drawing obscene pictures on restroom walls. Smashing windows. Destroying school records. Defacing library books. Do not classify as DestructionDamageVandalism of Property: Incidents of burning that willfully or maliciously destroy, damage or deface property. Classify such incidents as Arson. Classifying a crime as a Hate Crime is sometimes difficult. The following information adapted from the FBIs Hate Crime Data Collectio n Guidelines and Training Manual should be useful in guiding you. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-30 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Before an incident can be classified as a Hate Crime, sufficient objective facts must be present to lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the offenders actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by bias. While no single fact may be conclusive, facts such as the following, particularly when combined, are supportive of a finding of bias: a. The offender and the victim were of a different race, religion, disability, sexual orien tation, ethnicity, national origin, gender or gender identity. For example, the victim was African American and the offender was white. b. Bias-related oral comments, written statements or gestures were made by the offender , that indicate the offenders bias. For example, the offender shouted a racial epithet at the victim. c. Bias-related drawings, markings, symbols or graffiti were left at the crime scene.

For example, a swastika was painted on the door of a synagogue, anti- Islamic statements on the wall of a mosque, or anti- gay graffiti on the door of an LGBTQ center. d. Certain objects, items or things which indicate bias were used. For example, the offenders taped a photo of a burning cross to the door of an African American students dorm room. e. The victim is a member of a racial, religious, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, gender or gender identity group that is overwhelmingly outnumbered by other residents in the student housing facility where the victim lives and the incident took pl ace. This factor loses significance with the passage of time (i.e., it is most significant when the victim first moved into the facility, and becomes less and less significant as time passes without incident). f. Several incidents occurred in the same locatio n at or about the same time, and the victims were all of the same race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, gender or gender identity. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying a nd Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-31 g. A substantial portion of the campus community where the crime occurred perceived that t he incident was motivated by bias. h. The victim was engaged in activities related to his or her race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, gender or gender identity. For example, the victim was a member of the National Associ ation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) or participated in an LGBTQ Pride celebration. i. The incident coincided with a holiday or a date of particular significance relating to a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, gender or gender identity, e.g., Martin Luther King Day, Rosh Hashanah or the Transgender Day of Remembrance. j. The offender was previously involved in a similar Hate Crime or is a hate group member. k. There were indications that a hate group was involved. For example, a hate group claimed responsibility for the crime or was active on the campus. l. A historically established animosity existed between the victims and the offenders groups. m. The victim, although not a member of the targeted racial, religious, disability, sexual-orientation, ethnic, national origin, gender or gender identity group, was a member of an advocacy group supporting the precepts of the victim group. Additional considerations in determining whether an incident is a Hate Crime: Need for a case- by-case assessment of the facts.

For example, the offender used an epithet to refer to the Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-32 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting victims race, but the offender and victim were of the same race. Feigned facts. Be alert to evidence left by the offenders that is meant to give the false impression that the incident was motivated by bias. For example, students of a religious school vandalize their own school, leaving anti-religious statements and symbols on its walls in the hope that they will be excused from attending class. Offenders mistaken perception. Even if the offender was mistaken about the victims race, religion, disability, sexual-orientation, ethnicity, national origin, gender or gender identity, the offense is still a Hate Crime as long as the offender was motivated by bias against that group. For example, a non-gay student leaving a publicized LGBTQ meeting in a noncampus fraternity house is followed back to campus and attacked behind a dorm by six teenagers who mistakenly believed the victim is gay. Although the offenders were mistaken, the offense is a Hate Crime because it was motivated by the offenders anti -gay bias. Remember, it is the perception of the offender, not the perception of the victim that determines whether a crime is classified as a Hate Crime. Also, knowing that an offender is prejudiced is not enough to classify a crime as a Hate Crime. There must be evidence that the offender was motivated by that prejudice to commit the crime. Rules for Counting Hate Crimes Hate Crimes are counted in the same manner that the offenses are when they are not Hate Crimes except that the Hierarchy Rule does not apply to H ate Crimes. This means that: You must count all of the offenses committed in a multiple offense incident that are bias -motivated. For example, there is a single reported incident involving an Aggravated Assault and a Motor Vehicle Theft that were both motivated by bias. Include the incident in the statistics for both crimes. Remember, it is the perception of the offender, not the perception of the victim that determines whether a crime is classified as a Hate Crime . Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying a nd Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-33 In reporting the number of Hate Crimes, you must include only the crimes that are bias -motivated as Hate Crimes in a multiple -offense incident.

Include only the Sexual Assault as a Hate Crime. For any Criminal Offense that is also a Hate Crime, your statistics should indicate the offense and also the offense with the category of bias. For example, if an Aggravated Assault is a Hate Crime, include one Aggravated Assault in the statistics in the Criminal Offenses category and one Aggravated Assault motivated by (category of bias) in the Hate Crime category. The exception is when the Aggravated Assault is not included in the C riminal Offenses category because of the hierarchy rule. For example, for a single incident involving both a Rape and an Aggravated Assault that were both H ate Crimes, include only the Rape in the Criminal Offenses category and both the Rape and the Aggravated Assault in the H ate Crimes category. Examples of Hate Crimes Scenario 1: One night a student with known anti-gay sentiments steals a number of books by LGBT Q authors from a campus library exhibit. He leaves a note on the exhibit table that reads, Gay and lesbian books dont belong in our library. When he is caught leaving the library with a large bag of books, he starts shouting that LGBTQ students have been getting too much attention on campus and he was tired of it. Include this as one on- campus Larceny-Theft characterized by Sexual Orientation bias. Scenario 2: A white student causes a disturbance in an on-campus classroom during a discussion on race relations. The student begins shouting racial epithets while pointing at black students. The instructor calls campus security for assistance. A white security officer and a black security officer arrive. When the black officer tries to subdue the student, the student starts shoving the officer and shouting racial epithets at him.

Do not include this incident as a Hate Crime in your Clery Act statistics. Scenario 4: During finals week, a gay faculty member gets a series of phone calls in his noncampus office. When he answers, the caller says that she hates gay people and then hangs up. On the third night, the caller says that the faculty member had better be careful because s omething terrible was about to happen to gay people at the school. The faculty member is afraid and calls the local police to report the threat. Include this as one noncampus Intimidation based on S exual Orientation bias. Scenario 5: Several students call the campus security office to report swastikas spray - painted on the walls in a hallway of an on-campus student housing facility. Campus security personnel investigate but cannot find conclusive evidence that the markings were bias-motivated. Do not include this incident as a Hate Crime in your Clery Act statistics. Scenario 6: Several students call the campus security office to report swastikas spray - painted on the hallway walls of an on-campus student housing facility on the floor where members of a Jewish student group live.

However, as they got close, one yelled We dont want no she-males around here! and a second one knocked her to the ground. Include this as one on- campus Simple Assault characterized by Gender Identity bias. Scenarios 12: For a fraternity prank, two students forcibly bring a developmentally disabled student back to their house on campus. They shave the students head, spelling out the word retard in his remaining hair. They record the incident on their cell phones and post it on the fraternity website, all the while mocking his disability and his slurred -speech protests.

These are Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and S talking. Sexual assault is included by the FBI as a Criminal Offense and is discussed in the Criminal Offense section earlier in this chapter. Do mestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking are considered crimes for the purposes of Clery Act reporting and are defined and discussed in this section. Dating V iolence is defined as violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the reporting partys statement and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. For the purposes of this definition Dating violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse. Dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence. We caution that differences in the culture of different people and their use of terms may mean that a reporting party may describe a dating relationship using different terms from how an institutional official might des cribe dating. When the reporting party asserts that there was a dating relationship, you should assume that the victim and perpetrator were in a dating relationship to avoid incorrectly omitting incidents. The victims use of terms such as hanging out or hooking up rather than dating, or whether or not the relationship is described as monogamous or serious should not be the determining factor. No matter who reports the incident, whether it is the victim or a third party, it is the responsibility of the institution to determine whether the incident should be included as D ating Violence.

Scenario 4: A dating couple is arguing on a public sidewalk in front of a campus building. The male slaps the female and her face is red.

Domestic V iolence is defined as a felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed By a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; By a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; By a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the victim as a spouse or intimate partner; By a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred; By any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that persons acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-38 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting To categorize an incident as D omestic Violence, the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim must be more than just two people living together as roommates. The people cohabitating must be current or former spouses or have an intimate relationship. Examples of Domestic Violence Scenario 1: A students wife is waiting fo r her husband outside of his on-campus classroom building. She attacks her husband with a knife when he exits the building. Include this as one on-campus incident of Domestic Violence and one on-campus Aggravated Assault. Scenario 2: A neighbor reports ye lling in the apartment next door in a university housing complex. The officer who arrives at the apartment finds a husband and wife having an argument. Neither party reports any physical injuries and neither party reports being intimidated. Do not include this incident in your Clery Act statistics. Scenario 3: An employee reports to the campus police that her ex-husband has physically assaulted her four times.

He eventually hits his son, breaking his jaw. Include this as one on-campus incident of Domestic Violence and one Aggravated Assault. Stalking is defined as engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to Fear for the persons safety or the safety of others; or Suffer substantial emotional distress. For the purposes of this definition Course of conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying a nd Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-39 about a person, or interferes with a persons property. Reasonable person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim. Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily require medical or other professional treatment or counseling. Additional Guidance for Counting Stalking Record each report of Stalking as occurring at only the first location within the institutions Clery Act geography in which either the perpetrator engaged in the Stalking course of conduct or the victim first became aware of the Stalking. It is not necessary for all activities in the course of conduct to occur on Clery Act geography in order to count the incident. A Stalking incident in which only one or some of the activities took place on Clery Act geography must be included in the reported statistics. A single course of conduct may include varying S talking activities and may include acts committed over electronic communication (e.g., emails, texts or social media). When recording reports of S talking that include activities in more than one calendar year, an institution must record a crime statistic for each and every year in which the course of conduct is reported to a local police agency or to a campus security authority. Although not required in the statistical reporting, an institution may provide additional information to further describe the reports of Stalking included in the crime statistics. 3 For example, you may find it useful to explain whether a report represents Stalking that continued across multiple calendar years, whether the Stalking continued despite interventions by the institution or other parties, whether it lasted for a short but intense period or occurred intermittently over several months, and whether the perpetrator or the victim was located on or within the institutions Clery", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 58, "word_count": 500}

It is not necessary for all activities in the course of conduct to occur on Clery Act geography in order to count the incident . Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-40 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting However, in providing any additional information the institution must not include information that will identify the victim or the perpetrator. You are not required to follow up with victims each year to determine whether the behavior has continued, although you are not precluded from doing so. If the institution learns that the behavior has continued into another calendar year, the institution must record the behavior as a new report of S talking in that year. Otherwise, institutions must re cord only reports that they receive in each year. If Stalking occurs on more than one institutions Clery Act geography and is reported to a campus security authority at each institution, both institutions must include the S talking in their statistics. Although the Clery Act does not require an institution that learns of Stalking occurring on another campus to alert the other campus, other laws may require such an alert and we strongly encourage an institution in this situation to do so. Examples of Stalking Scenario 1: A female student reports that she is being followed by a man she met at her job at a caf\u00e9 off -campus. He began showing up at the caf\u00e9 and would not leave her alone. Since then she has also noticed him following her around campus and she fears for her safety. Include this as one incident of Stalking on-campus since the first occurrence on Clery Act geography occurred when the victim noticed the perpetrator following her on-campus. Scenario 2: Several students belonging to the university association of Hispanic students have reported being watched or followed by the same unknown man on various parts of campus. All of the students reported fearing for their safety as a result of his behavior but none of the students saw the man more than once. Do not include this as Stalking in your Clery Act statistics because, given that the man has never approached the same student more than once, the course of conduct was not directed at a single individual, Scenario 3: A female student reported that she is afraid for her safety because her ex - boyfriend has been sending harassing emails to her private email account over the past several weeks.

She came directly to the Campus Police to report the behavior. The location of the ex-boyfriend when he was sending the harassing messages is unknown. Include this as one on-campus Stalking becaus e the first incident in the course of conduct to occur on Clery Act geography was the victim reading the email on -campus. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying a nd Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-41 Examples of Stalking (continued) Scenario 4: A male student reports that his ex -girlfriend has been sending him harassing text messages. The ex -girlfriend attends another university 200 miles away. While at home over summer break, the ex-girlfriend showed up at the students house every day asking if he has a new girlfriend at school. Now that he has returned to school, she sends him daily text messages threatening to check -in on him on- campus. The ex -girlfriend sends these text messages late at night and the victim receives them when he is inside h is on-campus dorm room. Include one incident of Stalking in both the on-campus category and in the on- campus student housing facility category if the male student fears for his safety as a result of this behavior. Scenario 5: A male student reported a Stalking course of conduct to Campus Police during the spring semester. During the investigation, Campus Police established that the first incident in the Stalking course of conduct to occur on Clery Act geography took place on public property. When the student returned to campus for the fall semester, the S talking continued when the perpetrator repeatedly waited for the victim in the hallway outside the victims dorm room in an on-campus student housing facility. Since the spring and fall Stalking incidents involved the same victim and the same perpetrator, the fall incidents should be considered a continuation of the Stalking course of conduct that started in the spring. Include this as one Stalking incident on public property. Rules for Counting VAWA Offenses The Hierarchy Rule does not apply to VAWA Offenses. Therefore, for any Criminal Offense, Hate Crime, or arrest for Weapons, D rug or Liquor Law Violations that is also a VAWA Offense, your statistics must reflect the original offense and the VAWA Offense. For example, if an Aggravated Assault is also Domestic Violence, include the incident as one Aggravated Assault in the Criminal Offenses category and as an incident of Domestic Violence in the VAWA Offenses category.

Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-42 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Arrests and Disciplinary Referrals for Violation of Weapons, Drug Abuse and Liquor Laws Arrests and referrals citation 34 CFR 668.46(c)(1)(ii) The fourth category of crime statistics you must disclose is the number of arrests and the number of persons referred for disciplinary action for the following law violations: 1. Weapons: Carrying, Possessing, Etc.; 2. Drug Abuse Violations; and 3. Liquor Law Violations. You must report statistics for violations of the law that occur on your Clery Act geography and result in arrests or persons being referred for disciplinary action. Do not include violations of your institutions policies that resulted in persons being referred for disciplinary action if there was no violation of the law. For example, if a student of legal drinking age in the state in which your institution is located violates your institutions dry campus policy and is referred for disciplinary action dont include that incident in your Clery Act statistics because the referral was n ot the result of a law violation. Because state laws and local ordinances vary widely, you need to ascertain the specific laws and ordinances that apply to your institution. If an individual is both arrested and referred for disciplinary action for an offense, include only the arrest in your statistics. Note that arrests and referrals for these law violations are not covered by the Hierarchy Rule used to count Criminal Offenses. Therefore, you must count arrests for Weapons, D rug Abuse and Liquor Law Violations in addition to the most serious C riminal Offense when occurring in a single incident. For example, if an Aggravated Assault is committed with the use of a firearm in violation of a weapons law, count both the Aggravated A ssault and the arrest or referral for the Weapons Law Violation. Do not include violations of your institutions policies that resulted in persons being referred for disciplinary action if there w as no violation of the law. Note that arrests and referrals for these law violations are not covered by the Hierarchy Rule used to count Criminal Offenses . Chapter 3.

Juveniles taken into custody or arrested but merely warned and released without being charged. A juvenile should be counted as arrested when the circumstances are such that if the individual were an adult, an arrest would have been counted. Any situation where a young person, in lieu of actual arrest, is summoned, cited or notified to appear before the juvenile or youth court, or similar official for a violation of the law. Only violations by young persons where some police or official action is taken beyond a mere interview, warning or admonishment. Do not classify as arrests incidents in which: Police contact a juvenile who has not committed an offense. Police take a juvenile into custody for his or her own protection, but the juvenile did not commit a crime. Officers make call backs or follow -up contacts with young offenders for the purpose of determining their progress. An individual makes a citizens arrest. The arrest was for something other than a violation of a weapons, drug abuse or liquor law (e.g., an arrest for an Aggravated Assault) . A civil citation is issued. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-44 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Rules for Counting Arrests for Weapons: Carrying, Possessing, Etc., Drug Abuse Violations; and Liquor Law Violations Count the number of arrests for Weapons: Carrying, Possessing, Etc., the number of arrests for Drug Abuse Violations and the number of arrests for Liquor Law Violations. If a single incident involving a Liquor L aw Violation resulted in the arrest of 10 students, count this as 10 arrests. If the same person is arrested for multiple incidents in the same calendar year (e.g., one arrest in February and one arrest in March), count this as two arrests. Count this as two arrests even when both arrests are for the same type of violation (e.g., both were Drug Abuse Violations). If an individual is arrested for one type of law violation and referred for disciplinary action for a different type of law violation during a single incident (e.g., arrested for a Drug Abus e Violation and referred for a Liquor Law Violation), count only the arrest. If a person is both arrested and referred for disciplinary action for a single incident involving a law violation (e.g., a Drug Abuse Violation), count only the arrest. If a perso n is arrested for multiple violations during a single incident (e.g., violations of both drug abuse and liquor laws), law enforcement or security officer discretion should be used to determine which violation to count. We recommend that you document the justification for this determination. Officer discretion is allowed only for Weapons, D rug Abuse and Liquor L aw Violation arrests resulting from a single incident.

(See Chapter 9 for more on documentation requirements.) Referred for disciplinary action is defined as the referral of any person to any official who initiates a disciplinary action of which a record is established and which may result in the imposition of a sanction. The disciplinary process at your institution might be called disciplinary action, mediation, judicial process or some other term. The referral may, but doesnt have to, originate with the police. Regardless of what you call it, if the process involves the following three cr iteria, its a disciplinary action under the Clery Act : The official receiving the referral must initiate a disciplinary action, A record of the action must be established, and The action may, but does not have to, result in a sanction. Note that a disciplinary action can be initiated in an informal as well as a formal manner. It can include an interview or an initial review of names submitted to an official. So too, sanctions can be formal or informal, punitive or educational. For example, requiring comple tion of a Dangers of Alcohol education seminar in lieu of an arrest for underage alcohol possession must be included as one referral for disciplinary action for a Liquor Law Violation. Documentation of the referral must be maintained for purposes of Clery Act compliance for three years from the latest publication of the annual security report to which they apply.

Do not count the number of persons who were referred for disciplinary action solely for violation of institutional policy. Only count the number of persons referred for violations of the law. If a person is referred for disciplinary action for multiple incidents in the same calendar year (e.g., one referral in February and one referral in March), count this as two referrals for disciplinary action.

Crime Statistics: Classifying a nd Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-47 How to Classify the Law Violations 1. Weapons: Carrying, Possessing, Etc., is defined as the violation of laws or ordinances prohibiting the manufacture, sale, purchase, transportation, possession, concealment, or use of firearms, cutting instruments, explosives, incendiary devices or other deadly weapons. This classification encompasses weapons offenses that are regulatory in nature. Classify as a Weapons: Carrying, Possessing, Etc., Violation: Manufacture, sale, or possession of deadly weapons. Carrying deadly weapons, concealed or openly. Using, manufacturing, etc., of s ilencers. Furnishing deadly weapons to minors. Aliens possessing deadly weapons. Attempts to commit any of the above. This type of violation is not limited to deadly weapons; it also applies to weapons used in a deadly manner. For example, if there is a local or state law prohibiting the possession of brass knuckles, and an individual is arrested for possessing them on your Clery Act geography, the arrest must be included in your Clery Act statistics. 2. Drug Abuse Violations are defined as the violation of laws prohibiting the production, distribution andor use of certain controlled substances and the equipment or devices utilized in their preparation andor use. The unlawful cultivation, manufacture, distribution, sale, purchase, use, possession, transportation or importation of any controlled drug or narcotic substance. Arrests for violations of state and local laws, specifically those relating to the unlawful possession, sale, use, growing, manufacturing and making of narcotic drugs.

This means that if you have campuses in different states, the laws may differ for each of them. All illegally obtain ed prescription drugs. Do not classify as a Drug Abuse Violation: Possession of a small amount of marijuana in states that have decriminalized this conduct, meaning that the conduct is no longer a criminal offense. Referrals that occur for this decriminal ized conduct should not be counted for Clery Act reporting purposes. Use of legally obtained, personal prescription drugs used by the owner in a manner not consistent with the instructions provided by the physician. 3. Liquor Law Violations are defined as the violation of state or local laws or ordinances prohibiting the manufacture, sale, purchase, transportation, possession or use of alcoholic beverages, not including driving under the influence and drunkenness.

For Clery Act purposes, the standard for unfounding a reported crime is very high. You may classify a crime as unfounded only after a full investigation by sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel. A crime is considered unfounded for Clery Act purposes only if sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel make a formal determination that the report is false or baseless. Crime reports can be properly determined to be false only if the evidence from a complete and thorough investigation establishes that the crime reported was not, in fact, completed or attempted in any manner. Crime reports can be determined to be baseless only if the allegations reported did not meet the elements of the offense or were improperly classified as crimes in the first place.

Crime reports can be determined to be baseless only if the allegations reported did not meet the elements of the offense or were improperly classified as crimes in the first place. A reported crime cannot be designated unfounded if no investigation was conducted or the investigation was not completed. Nor can a crime report be designated unfounded merely because the investigation failed to prove that the crime occurred; this would be an inconclusive or unsubstantiated investigation. As such, for Clery Act purposes, the determination to unfound a crime can be made only when the totality of available information specifically indicates that the report was false or baseless. The recovery of stolen property or the low valuation of stolen property is not adequate grounds for unfounding a reported Robbery, Burglary, or Larceny-Theft. Similarly with regard to sex offenses, subsequent acts or inactions on the part of a victim, a witness, or a third party are not an independent ground for unfounding a reported crime. A reported crime may not be unfounded solely because a victim or witness fails to follow an institutions rules for filing a complaint or is unwilling to provide additional information or evidence, or to otherwise assist in an investigation or prosecution. Moreover, a crime may not be unfounded simply because a complainant agrees to execute a Declination to Prosecute form or because a prosecutor subsequently decides not to pursue criminal charges. The mere lack of sufficient evidence to make an arrest is not adequate grounds to unfound a crime report either. A case cannot be designated unfounded if no investigation was conducted or the investigation was not completed. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying and Counting Clery Act Crimes 3-52 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Finally, determinations by a coroner, court or jury may not be used to unfound reports of offenses or attempts. A verdict that a particular defendant is not guilty of a particular charge (or, more technically, that there was not sufficient admissible evidence introduced demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime) does not mean that the crime did not occur. The inclusion of a reported crime in the Clery Act statistics is not based on the identity of a specific perpetrator. Aid for Counting Unfounded Crimes To count a crime as unfounded for Clery Act purposes, the reported crime must have been a Clery Act crime; reported to have occurred on Clery Act geography; thoroughly investigated by sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel; and found through investigation to be false or baseless, meaning that the crime did not occur and was never attempted. Do not count as u nfounded crimes: Crimes that were initially misclassified. Do not count a crime as unfounded if investigation shows that a crime has occurred but the initial description of the crime was inaccurate.

Reports from local law enforcement of unfounded arrests. Arrests cannot be unfounded. Disciplinary referrals in which it is determined through the disciplinary process that no law violation occurred or no sanction is imposed. Once a student has been referred for disciplinary action, a record has been initiated and the referral must be counted. Disciplinary referrals cannot be unfounded. Reports from local law enforcement of crimes that were unfounded because the victim refused to cooperate with authorities or there was not enough evidence to press charges. To be unfounded, investigation must prove that the crime did not occur and was never attempted. Findings of a judge , jury, disciplinary committee or any other person or entity that is not a sworn or commissioned law enforcement officer. A district attorney may unfound a crime only if he or she is also a sworn or commissioned law enforcement officer. Reports of crimes where the victim later retracts his or her statement , or withdraws a complaint, unless a thorough investigation proves that the crime did not occur and was never attempted. A victim might retract his or her statement because he or she does not want to continue to answer questions or is being pressured by the perpetrator or other parties.

If a crime is unfounded, it should not be included in the Clery Act statistics for the associated crime category, and should be removed from any previously reported statistics for that crime category. The unfounded crime should be included in the total count of unfounded crimes for the year in which the crime was originally reported. Consistent with other recordkeeping requirements that pertain to the Title IV, HEA programs, if a crime was not included in the Clery Act statistics for the associated crime category because it was unfounded, you must maintain accurate documentation of the reported crime and the basis for unfounding the crime. This documentation must demonstrate that the determination to unfound the crime was based on the results of the law enforcement investigation and evidence. In addition, institutions that have a campus security or police department must include all reported crimes in their crime log. The crime log must include the nature, date, time and general location of each crime, as well as the disposition of the complaint. If a crime report is determined to be unfounded, you must update the disposition of the complaint to unfounded in the crime log within two business days of that determination. You may not delete the report from the crime log. If you disclose a crime statistic and the crime is unfounded in a subsequent year, you should revise your statistics. Use a caveat to note that the change in a prior years statistics reflects the unfounding of a crime. Chapter 3. Crime Statistics: Classifying a nd Counting Clery Act Crimes The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 3-55 Excluded Crimes There are some crimes that you should not include in your institutions Clery Act statistics and others that you may exclude under particular circumstances. They are: Non-Clery Act crimes. If you disclose statistics for non-Clery Act crimes, disclose them in a manner separate from your Clery Act statistics. (More about how to present your statistics in Chapter 9.) Crimes not committed in geographic locations specified by the Clery Act . For example, although Rape is a Clery Act crime, where it was committed is important in determining if the crime must be included in the annual security report and the Web-based data collection.

This page intentionally left blank. The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 4-1 Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies CHAPTER 4 Now that you know all of the categories of crimes, arrests and referrals to disclose and how geography fits into compliance with campus safety and security regulations, you need to know how to obtain reportable statistics associated with that geography. This requirement involves collecting information from individuals and organizations associated with your institution (i.e., campus security authorities or CSAs) about crimes, arrests and referrals that have been reported to them, and requesting crime and arrest statistics from local law enforcement agencies. Well begin by discussing campus security authoriti es. Although every ins titution wants its campus community to report criminal incidents to law enforcement, we know that this doesnt always happen. Even at institutions with a police department on campus, a student who is the victim of a crime may report it to someone other than the campus police. For example, a victim of a sexual offense may turn to a resident advisor for assistance, or a student whose car was stolen may report the theft to the schools director. For this reason, the Clery Act requires all institutions to colle ct crime reports from a variety of individuals and organizations that are considered to be campus security authorities under the law. Under the Clery Act , a crime is reported when it is brought to the attention of a campus security authority, the institutions police department or campus safety office, or local law enforcement personnel by a victim, witness, other third party or even the offender. It doesnt matter whether or not the individuals involved in the crime, or reporting the crime, are associated with the institution. If a campus security authority receives a report, he or she must include it as a crime report using whatever procedure has been specified by your institution. What you must include, therefore, are statistics based on reports of alleged criminal incidents. It is not necessary for the crime to have been investigated by the police or a campus It is not necessary for the crime to have been investigated by the police or a campus security authority, nor must a finding of guilt or responsibility be made to include the reported crime in your institutions crime statistics .

How to Identify Your Institutions CSAs Campus security authority definition citation 34 CFR 668.46(a) Campus security authority is a Clery Act -specific term that encompasses four groups of individuals and organizations associated with an institution. A campus police department or a campus security department of an institution. If your institution has a campus police or security department, all individuals who work for that department are campus security authorities. A security department can be as small as one person. (More about this in Chapter 5.) Any individual or individuals who have responsibility for campus security but who do not constitute a campus police department or a campus security department (e.g., an individual who is responsible for monitoring the entrance into institutional property). Include individuals such as those who provide security at a campus parking kiosk, monitor acces s into a campus facility, act as event security , such as for sporting events or large, registered parties, or escort students around campus after dark (including other students). Any individual or organization specified in an institutions statement of cam pus security policy as an individual or organization to which students and employees should report criminal offenses. As mentioned in Chapter 1, your institution must publish a number of safety - and security -related policy statements. (These are discussed in Chapters 7 and 8.) If you direct the campus community to report criminal incidents to anyone or any organization in addition to police or security- related personnel, that individual or organization is a campus security authority. An official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline and campus judicial proceedings. An Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 4-3 official is defined as any person who has the authority and the duty to take action or respond to particular issues on behalf of the institution. Because official responsibilities and job titles vary significantly on campuses, we are not providing a list of specific job titles. To determine specifically which individuals or organizations are campus security authorities for your institution, consider the function of that individual or office. Look for officials (i.e., not support staff) whose functions involve relationships with students. If someone has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, he or she is a campus security authority. Note that whether or not your institution pays an individual is not a factor in determining whether that individual is a CSA.

Be sure to keep your CSA list current so that you do not omit any individual or organization that fits the definition of a CSA. Examples of individuals (outside of a police or security department) who generally meet the criteria for being campus security authorities include a dean of students who oversees student housing, a student center or student extracurricular activities ; a director of athletics, all athletic coaches (i ncluding part-time employees and graduate assistants) ; a faculty advisor to a student group; a student resident advisor or assistant; a student who monitors access to dormitories or buildings that are owned by recognized student organizations; a coordinator of Greek affairs ; a Title IX coordinator ; an ombudsperson (including student ombudspersons); the director of a campus health or counseling center; victim advocates or others who are responsible for providing victims with advocacy services, such as Be sure to keep your CSA list current so that you do not omit any individual or organization that fits the definition of a CSA . Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies 4-4 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting assisting with housing relocation, disciplinary action or court cases, etc. ; members of a sexual assault response team (SART) or other sexual assault advocates; and officers from local law enforcement who are contracted by the institution to provide campus safety-related services. If your institution directs students or employees to report crimes to other individuals, then those individuals are also CSAs. These individuals could include physicians in a campus health center ; counselors, including peer counselors (except for professional or pastoral counselors addressed later in this chapter) ; and health educators, including peer health educators. Examples of individuals who would not meet the criteria for being campus security authorities include a faculty member who does not have any responsibility for student and campus activity beyond the classroom; and clerical or cafeteria staff. The total number of CSAs at your institution depends on the number of individuals or organizations involved in security or that have significant responsibility for student and campus activities, not on the size of your school. Even a small school can have a number of CSAs. For example, yo ur school may have a director, a registrar and a faculty advisor who fit the CSA definition. On the other hand, perhaps only the director fits the definition. If your school does not have security personnel but has one administrator who has all of the responsibility for student and campus activities at the school, that administrator is your only CSA.

Remember, too, that because personnel and job positions can change, someone who is a CSA one year might not be a CSA the following year or vice versa. For example, suppose that you have a computer science instructor who is teaching at Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 4-5 the main campus. She isnt a CSA because she doesnt have any responsibility for student and campus activity beyond the classroom. The following year, this instructor is teaching computer science at one of your institutions noncampus locations. Because there arent any security personnel on site, your institutions security policy identifies this instructor as the person to whom students should report crimes or other emergencies t hat occur there. This instructor is now a campus security authority. Institutions are advised to reevaluate the CSA status of all employees (including student employees) on at least an annual basis and document the rationale of the determinations. Please note that, while there may be some overlap, persons considered to be CSAs for Cl ery Act reporting are not necessarily the same as those defined as responsible employees for Title IX. What Does a Campus Security Authority Do? The function of a campus security authority is to report to the official or office designated by the institution to collect crime report information, such as the campus police or security department, those allegations of Clery Act crimes that he or she receives. CSAs are responsible for reporting allegations of Clery Act crimes that are reported to them in their capacity as a CSA. This means that CSAs are not responsible for investigating or reporting incidents that they overhear students talking about in a hallway conversation; that a classmate or student mentions during an in- class discussion; that a victim mentions during a speech, workshop, or any other form of group presentation; or that the CSA otherwise learns about in an indirect manner. While there may be some overlap, persons considered to be CSAs for Clery Act reporting are not necessarily the same as those defined as responsible employees for Title IX. Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies 4-6 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Examples of Collecting Crime Information Scenario 1: A resident assistant who has been identified as a CSA is told by a fellow student that she has been raped and is seeking emotional and medical support.

Scenario 2: A student mentions to her boyfriend that a number of rooms on her dorm floor were broken into during the previous nights footba ll game. Later that day, her boyfriend tells the athletics director (AD) what he heard. The AD asks which dorm it was and what, if anything else, the boyfriend knows about the incident. The AD should document the information and forward it to the schools campus security department or the institutions designated official for inclusion in the statistics per the schools crime reporting policy. Scenario 3: Ms. Jones, director of Student Housing at your school, gets a call from the director of a counseling center in town. The caller wants to let the director know that four students from the school sought assistance at the center and told the centers counselors that they had been sexually assaulted on campus and were seeking emotional support. They did not want police investigations. These are third-party reports and Ms. Jones, having no reason to believe that they were not made in good faith, should document all of the information she was given and forward the reports to the person or office responsible for collecting Clery Act crime reports at her institution. Scenario 4: Jane, a resident advisor, is attending a Take Back the Night rally at her school. She attends the event as a participant and is not involved in providing any counseling services. As part of the events programming, a student gives a speech in which she says that she was raped on campus last year. In response to hearing the speech, three other students decide to address the crowd and disclose their own experiences being sexually assaulted. Af ter the event, Jane returns to her room where a student from her housing facility knocks on her door and tells her that she was sexually assaulted at an on- campus party in another housing facility three months ago. Jane should forward the report of the inc ident that was reported to her as she was acting in her capacity as an RA for her housing facility. Jane should not report the S exual Assaults that she heard discussed at the Take Back the Night event. What Shouldnt a Campus Security Authority Do? A campus security authority is not responsible for determining authoritatively whether a crime took place that is the function of law enforcement personnel. A campus security authority should not try to apprehend the alleged perpetrator of the crime. That too is the responsibility of law enforcement. Chapter 4.

Exemption for Pastoral and Professional Counselors Campus security authority exemptions citation 34 CFR 668.46(a) There are two types of individuals who, although they may have significant responsibility for student and campus activities, are not campus security authorities under the Clery Act: Pastoral counselor: A person who is associated with a religious order or denomination, is recognized by that religious order or denomination as someone who provides confidential counseling, and is functioning within the scope of that recognition as a pastoral counselor. Professional counselor: A person whose official responsibilities include providing mental health counseling to members of the institutions community and who is functioning within the scope of the counselors license or certification. This definition applies even to professional counselors who are not employees of the institution, but are under contract to provide counseling at the institution. The pastoral or professional counselor exemption is intended to ensure that these individuals can provide appropriate counsel ing services without an obligation to report crimes they may learn about. This exemption is intended to protect the counselor- client relationship . However, even the legally recognized privileges acknowledge some exemptions, and there may be situations in which counselors are in fact under a legal obligation to report a crime. To be exempt from disclosing reported offenses, pastoral or professional counselors must be acting in the role of pastoral or professional counselors. State licensing requirements for professional counselors typically include completion of a minimum of 3,000 hours of post- masters degree supervised clinical experience, performed within two years before a license is awarded. If an unlicensed counselor has completed his or her masters de gree course work, and is acting in the role of a licensed counselor under the supervision of a licensed professional in order to gain the required supervised clinical Chapter 4.

An example is a Ph.D. counselor- trainee acting under the supervision of a professional counselor at the institution. However, a dean of students who has a professional counselors license but is employed by the institution only as a dean and not as a counselor, is not exempt from reporting. If that same dean is employed by the institution as both a professional counselor and an academic counselor, and she learns of a criminal incident while she is engaged in academic counseling, she is not exempt from reporting that incident. Note also, that if your institution has an individual with dual roles, one as a professional or pastoral counselor and the other as an official who qualifies as a CSA, and the roles cannot be separated , that individual is considered a campus security authority and is obligated to report Clery Act", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 76, "word_count": 500}

An individual who is counseling students andor employees, but who does not meet the Clery Act definition of a pastoral or professional counselor, is not exempt from bei ng a campus security authority if they otherwise have significant responsibility for student and campus activities. This may include a triage nurse at the student health center or crisis intervention staff at the rape crisis clinic at your institution. In most cases it is possible for a CSA to fulfill his or her responsibilities while still maintaining victim confidentiality. CSA reports are used by the institution to compile statistics for Clery Act reporting and to help determine if there is a serious or continuing threat to the safety of the campus community that would require an alert (i.e., a timely warning or emergency notification discussed in Chapter 6). However, those responsibilities can usually be met without disclosing personally identifying information. 4 A CSA report does not need to automatically result in the initiation of a police or disciplinary investigation if the victim does not want to pursue this action. 4 Personally identifying information is defined in section 40002(a)(20) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and is incorporated into the Clery Act regulations; therefore, this handbook uses the term personally identifying information when discussing Clery Act requirements. Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 4-9 Recommendations The Clery Act regulations do not address coordinating your crime reporting process or training your campus security authorities. However, because the role of CSAs is vital to compliance with the law, many schools have requested suggestions for doing so. The following section addresses those requests by providing re commendations not requirements which your school can adapt to meet its unique configuration and needs. As you read them, please keep in mind that the effort and coordination needed to comply with the requirement to collect crime reports varies significantl y depending on several factors, such as the size of your school, the number of individuals or offices that meet the campus security authority definition, whether your school has law enforcement or security personnel and whether you provide student housing. Designate an individual or office to coordinate and oversee your campus security authorities. This can be particularly helpful for schools with a large number of CSAs. Assign someone who is knowledgeable about the Clery Act to coordinate everything from identifying your institutions CSAs to making sure all CSAs provide information on any crimes reported to them.

Rather than assuming that because a CSA hasnt forwarded a crime report to the appropriate individual or office no crimes were reported to that CSA, a coordinator can be charged with canvassing each CSA to request crime reports from them. CSAs who dont have crimes to report can be asked to document this in writing. This could be as simple as writing a statement that reads, From ______to _____ I was not aware of, and did not receive, any reports of criminal incidents, arrests or disciplinary actions for Clery Act crimes. Even if crime reports are submitted online, its a good idea to ask CSAs to indicate if they have no crimes to report. Make sure your campus security authorities know they are campus security authorities . To do this, we suggest that you update the job descriptions of individuals at your institution who fit the definition of a CSA. Make this designation an official part of their job description so that they know whats required of them. You may also want to contact all CSAs annually in writing to Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies 4-10 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting remind them of this obligation. Because of turnover, or a change in job descriptions, you may have to notify some individuals mid -year. Provide training. CSAs have an important job to do and providing them with training will help to ensure that they do it properly. Training can be provided in a variety of ways, ranging from sending materials in an e -mail to face -to-face meetings that include PowerPoint presentations and training manuals. Whatever form your training takes, page 4 -11 provides some elements you might want to include. Forward crime reports to your campus police or security department, if you have one. Provide a simple mechanism for CSAs to report information to the person or office responsible for compiling the institutions crime statistics. CSA crime reports should include sufficient detail , such as dates and locations , and, where appropriate, personally identifying information, including name and contact information if available. Encourage CSAs to immediately forward reports of crimes to the designated officials, whether they be your campus police or security department if you have one, or to another official charged with this responsibility. This is because a CSA crime report may be the basis for determining if there is a serious or continuing threat to the safety of the campus community that would require an alert (i.e., a timely warning or emergency notification). Also, if your institution has a campus police or security department and a crime is reported to a non - policesecurity CSA, the report should be forwarded to your campus police or securi ty department so that it will be entered in your institutions daily crime log in a timely manner.

Keep hard copy or electronic documentation for all CSA- reported crimes an d make sure that more than one person knows where the documentation is kept. If there is reason to believe that a crime report was not made in good faith, and your institution does not include the reported incident in its crime statistics, we strongly sugg est that you document the justification for not including the crime in those statistics. Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 4-11 If your institution contracts with a third party to provide security services, ensure that the contracted company shares documentation of all incidents so that you can meet Clery Act requirements for retaining records. As discussed further in Chapter 9 , you must retain all records used in compiling your annual security report for three years from the latest publication of the report to which they apply. Figure 5. Sugge sted Training Elements for Campus Security Authorities Describe the role of a CSA The Clery Act is a federal law that requires the institution to identify individuals and organizations that meet the definition of a campus security authority. CSAs have an important role in ensuring that the school complies with the law. Explain that CSA crime reports are used by the school to fulfill its responsibility to annually disclose accurate crime statistics ; and to issue or facilitate the issuance of timely warnings or emergency notifications for crimes that pose a serious or continuing threat to the campus community. If an individual reporting an incident needs assistance, a CSA should explain how to get help. Let a victim know that help is available even if he or she does not want an investigation conducted. The decision to act on this option is the victims. In the midst of an emergency situation, such as a physical assault, however, a CSA should contact the campus police or call 911, as appropriate. Provide reporting materials Good recordkeeping can help minimize the chances of double reporting crimes. Suggested materials are descriptions, a map, or both, of the schools Clery Act geography ; a list of Clery Act crimes and definitions ; and hard copy or electronic Crime Report forms for documenting criminal incidents. Discuss the importance of documentation Explain that if a CSA is unsure of whether an incident is a Clery Act crime, or even if its criminal in nature, they should report it. Stress the importance of providing as much information about a reported incident as possible to aid law enforcement in addressing and categorizing the crime.

Emphasize the need for timely report submission Explain that if a crime is reported to a CSA, but goes no further than that, the school wont have fulfilled its obligation under the law, and campus community members might not have the information they need to stay safe on campus.

Local law enforcement agencies do not include your campus police or security department (if you have one). The campus police and security departments are campus security authorities. Local law enforcement refers to outside law enforcement agencies or departments with jurisdiction over s ome or all of your Clery Act geography. If there are several agencies involved, for example, city police, tribal police, the county or parish sheriffs office and state police, you must request statistics from all agencies with jurisdiction over areas in y our schools Clery Act geography. You dont need to request statistics from local agencies that only provide court security, administer the jail, transport prisoners or serve papers, etc. You must ask for law enforcement statistics for Clery Act crimes that occurred on any area included in your institutions Clery Act geography: on campus, public property and noncampus locations , if you have any. It doesnt matter what the institutions relationship is with local law enforcement, nor does it matter if youve requested Clery Act statistics fr om them in the past and havent gotten a response; you must make the request annually. If your institution has multiple campuses, each campus must make this request to the appropriate local law enforcement agencies. And remember, if your institution has an additional campus in a foreign country, that campus also has an obligation to make a good- faith effort to obtain statistics from local law enforcement authorities in that area.", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 80, "word_count": 500}

Good-faith Effort The Clery Act doesnt require local law enforcement agencies to provide institutions with crime statistics. If you make a reasonable, good -faith effort to obtain the statistics, your institution is not responsible for the failure of the local or state police agency to supply them. The law states that an institution may rely on the information supplied by a local or state police agency. The phrase may rely on means that an institution is not required to verify the accuracy of the statistics that are provided; however, you are required to ensure that the You must ask for law enforcement statistics for Clery Act crimes that occurred on any area included in your institutions Clery Act geography: on campus, public property and noncampus locations , if you have any . Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 4-13 statistics you receive cover your Clery Act geography and not other areas. Remember that , in most cases, you will need to request only crime statistics, not the actual law enforcement reports, unless there are known issues with the way incidents were classified by a particular law enforcement agency. That said, you should be aware of red flags that alert you to the possibility that an agency misunderstood your request. In such a case, you should contact the agency for clarification. Red flags include: Statistics for B urglaries on public property: A Burglary is the unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or a theft. A structure has four walls, a roof and a door. To be a Burglary on publ ic property, there must be an element of trespass into a public structure on public land within your campus or immediately bordering your campus. For most institutions, public property is the public sidewalk, street and opposite sidewalk bordering the campus. Some institutions may also have public parking facilities in their public property category. A Burglary in this category is a rare event. Large numbers of crimes on public property: Public property is narrowly defined by the Clery Act . Large numbers ma y indicate statistics for private homes and businesses or for an entire police jurisdiction. Missing geography: The statistics you received are for crimes that occurred only on public property; however, you are certain that there were on -campus Clery Act crimes that were reported to the local police department.

Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies 4-14 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting How Do You Obtain Statistics From Local Law Enforcement? Other than making a good-faith effort, the Clery Act doesnt specify how an institution has to obtain the statistics. For institutions that are not experienced in these matters, we offer the following suggestions: Determine the correct law enforcement authorities and develop a relationship with them. You should request statistics from every law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over areas in your institutions Clery Act geography. If you are unsure where to begin, call your local area information number (generally 411), and give your institutions address to the operator. He or she can give you the telephone number of the local police who respond to calls for your location. You can also find this information on the Internet by searching for law enforcement along with the zip code in which your institution is located. Call that agency, and ask to speak with a supervisor or public affairs office. They should be able to point you to the appropriate person. Ask that individual what other law enforcement agencies have concurrent jurisdiction in the area where your institution is located. Be sure to include state law enforcement agencies. Remember to provide addresses for noncampus buildings or property if your institution has any. If you have an out-of-state noncampus location, you need to ask for the local law enforcement agency number for that zip code as well. (A sample letter to a law enforcement agency is included in Appendix B.) Contact local law enforcement early in the year. Contact agencies early in the calendar year for crime statistics for the previous year. Agencies, particularly those with extensive jurisdictions or those with a very small number of personnel, need time to collect the information you request. Providing them adequate advance notice may increase your chances of getting the requested statistics in a timely manner. Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 4-15 Document your good- faith effort to obtain the statistics, including follow -up requests. After you know who or what department to contact at each agency, we suggest that you write a letter, on your institutions official letterhead, if possible, explaining the following: What you need. Ask for statistics for all Clery Act crimes for your camp us; on-campus student housing facilities, if you have any; public property ; and noncampus buildings or property, if you have any.

For example, ask for crime statistics for the sidewalk, street and opposite sidewalk between the 1200 and 1400 blocks on Elm Street, rather than crime statistics for public property around the school. State that you do not need statistics about crimes at private homes or businesses. If your institution uses a map to identify its Clery Act geography, include the map with your request. Why you need it. State that the information is required by the federal Clery Act for disclosure in an annual security report and a Web -based data collection. The format in which you need it provided preferably in writing (either paper or electronic). Ask for statistics for crimes classified according to the UCR. If the local police agency does not use UCR classifications, and cant provide them, ask what classifications are used (e.g., state crime classifications). When you need it. Explain that you must disclose the statistics by Oct. 1 and suggest a reasonable deadline that will allow you some leeway. It may take considerable time and effort to review the statistics to prevent double counting the crimes reported by your i nstitutions CSAs and the crime statistics reported by local law enforcement agencies. Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies 4-16 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Where it should be sent. Provide your institutions mailing or e -mail address. To whom it should be sent. Provide the name and title of the person who is responsible for collecting these data for your institution. Even if you make a phone call asking for this information, we suggest that you follow up with a letter or an e-mail for the purpose of documenting your good- faith effort. Also document any response, or lack of response, from each agency that you contact. If your deadline for disclosing the crime statistics is fast approaching and you havent heard from an agency, contact them again and inquire about the status of your request. What to Do If You Are Directed to a Website In some jurisdictions, local law enforcement statistics are available on a public access website. In this case, the police may instruct you to visit the site to obtain the statistics. If you can identify the statistics for your schools Clery A ct geography from the statistics, and you can confirm that the website is up -to-date, this is an acceptable means of meeting the requirement. You are still, however, required by law to make an initial request for statistics annually directly to the agency.

What to Do If an Agency Requests Payment for the Statistics If an agency requests payment in return for providing your institution with statistics, you may pay the agency, but you are not required to do so. What to Do If You Obtain Non-UCR Statistics The Clery Act requires institutions and the Department to use the definitions of crimes in the FBIs Uniform Crime Reporting Program when compiling crime statistics for Clery Act purposes, but not all law enforcement agencies use these definitions. If you know that the statistics you obtained arent classified according to UCR definitions, and you have campus police personnel familiar with UCR definitions, they might be able to reclassify the cri mes. For example, if under the Robbery classification you receiv ed statistics for robbery of an apartment or safe robbery, the UCR equivalent would be Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 4-17 Burglary. (See Burglary in Chapter 3.) An incident classified by some agencies as breaking and entering with intent to commit a larceny, is also classified as Burglary in the UCR. You can also request clarification from the local law enforcement agency if you are not sure how a crime should be listed. If you cannot reclassify the statistics, include them in your disclosures with an explanation that UCR classifications were not used for crimes reported to local law enforcement agencies and included in the statistics. What to Do If You Obtain Statistics That You Cant Attribute to Your Clery Act Geography In some jurisdictions, local law enforcement agencies cannot provide a breakdown of statistics specific to Clery Act geographic areas. For example, the police may provide your institution with statistics for the entire jurisdiction or the entire city, or they may include statistics for private residences and businesses. If the statistics are all zeros, that isnt a problem. If not, we suggest that you request addresses for the crimes included in the statistics to help you determine if any of the crimes occurred on your Clery Act geography. If you can determine that some of the crimes occurred in or on your Clery Act geography, but you cant determine if they occurred on your campus or public property, disclose those statistics in an additional table or in a caveat explaining why they are separated from your other Clery Act statistics. If you cannot determine whether any of the crime statistics apply to or include your Clery Act geography, provide a caveat in your annual security report explaining that the statistics were requested but were not available in a usable format for Clery Act reporting.

(More about how to disclose statistics in your annual security report and in the Web- based survey in Chapter 9.) What to Do If Your Request for Statistics Is Denied If a law enforcement agency that you contact does not comply with your request for crime statistics, document both your request for the statistics and the response, or lack of response, from the agency. You should also consult state and local open records laws to see if law enforcement agencies are required to provide crime statistics to citizens and organizations that request them. If some of the agencies provide you with statistics and others dont, be sure to include Chapter 4. Collecting Statistics: Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies 4-18 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting the statistics you did receive in yo ur reported crime statistics. Add an explanation to tell the reader that not all of the agencies responded to your request for statistics, or that not all of the agencies could provide the statistics as requested. Remember, requesting Clery Act crime statistics from local law enforcement agencies is an institutional obligation. This means that if you assign someone the responsibility to request and review the statistics, and that person for whatever reason is unable to do so, your institution is still responsible for complying with the law. You must make this effort in time to include the statistics in your annual security report which must be published by Oct. 1. The same statistics must also be entered in the Web -based data collection in the fall. The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 5-1 The Daily Crime Log: Recording Crimes Reported To Campus Police or Security Personnel CHAPTER 5 Daily crime log citation 34 CFR 668.46(f) Does your institution have a campus police or security department? Any institution, regardless of whether its public or private, that has a campus police or security department, must create, maintain and make available a daily crime log. For Clery Act purposes, there are various arrangements that constitute a campus police or security department. For example, some institutions choose not to provide such services with institution staff, and instead contract with a private company to handle campus security. Others have agreements with municipal, county or state law enforcement agencies for security services. It doesnt matter if your security staff is paid by your institution or by a contractor, or if you have one security officer or a police department. Any of these arrangements put your institution in the category of having a security department. On the other hand, your institution is not considered to have a security department and, therefore, is not required to maintain a crime log if you only have local law enforcement personnel who patrol on or near your campus, but the local law enforcement agency", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 85, "word_count": 500}

On the other hand, your institution is not considered to have a security department and, therefore, is not required to maintain a crime log if you only have local law enforcement personnel who patrol on or near your campus, but the local law enforcement agency does not have a written agreement or contract with your institution for these services; an individual or individuals with limited responsibility for campus security (e.g., someone monitoring access to a campus building by checking student IDs) but who does not perform other security services; or security personnel employed or contracted by a landlord from whom your institution rents classroom space. Chapter 5. The Daily Crime Log: Recording Crimes Reported To Campus Police or Security Personnel 5-2 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting The determination of whether or not your institutions security personnel constitute a campus police or security department must be consistent with the campus security policy statement you disclose in your annual security report (more about this in Chapter 7). Purpose of the Daily Crime Log The purpose of the daily crime log is to record all criminal incidents and alleged criminal incidents that are reported to the campus police or security department. For example, if a student tells your security office that he lost his wallet in the parking lot behind a dorm, it is not a criminal incident, and you arent required to record it in the log. However, if a student tells your security office that his wallet was stolen from his dorm room, this is an alleged criminal incident which must be recorded in the log. Some traffic violations are criminal in nature and , if reported, must be recorded. They are driving under the influence (DUI), driving while intoxicated (DWI), hit- and-run (of a person) and vehicular manslaughter. However, you are not required to record violations that arent considered crimes (i.e., citations for moving violations). What to Do If Your Institution Also Has a State Crime Log Many institutions are also required by state law to maintain a log. If your institution maintains such a log, you may use it for your daily crime log as well, if it meets all Clery Act requirements. However, if the state crime log requires the victims names to be listed, the log would not meet the requirements of the Clery Act , which provides that a crime log entry may not jeopardize the confidentiality of the victim. Combining the Daily Crime Log and the Fire Log If your institution has any on-campus student housing facilities, you are required to maintain a fire log. You may, but are not required to, use one log to meet the crime log and the fire log req uirements if you label the log accordingly and the common log meets all of the requirements for both logs.

The Daily Crime Log: Recording Crimes Reported To Campus Police or Security Personnel The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 5-3 How the Crime Log Differs From Other Campus Safety and Security Disclosures The crime log differs from other disclosure requirements in some important ways: Crime log entries include all crimes reported to the campus police or security department for the required geographic locations, not just Clery Act crimes. The crime log includes specific information about criminal incidents, not crime statistics. The log is designed to provide crime information on a more timely basis than the annual statistical disclosures. A crime must be entered into the log within two business days of when it was reported to the campus police or security depa rtment. This includes crimes that are reported directly to the campus police or security department, as well as crimes that are initially reported to another campus security authority or to a local law enforcement agency, which subsequently reports them to the campus police or security department. The UCR Hierarchy Rule does not apply to the crime log. If multiple Criminal Offenses are committed during a single incident, all of the offenses must be recorded in the log. The log has a more specific location focus than the statistical disclosures. For example, the location might be recorded as on the second floor of the administration building rather than on campus. There is an additional geographic location that applies exclusively to the crime log . In addition to recording reported crimes that occurred on campus, in or on noncampus buildings or property or on public property within the campus or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus, reports of crimes that occurred within the patrol jurisdiction of the campus police or security department must also be entered into the crime log. A patrol jurisdiction (also referred to as a patrol zone) is any property that does not meet any of the Crime log entries include all crimes reported to the campus police or security department for the required geographic locations, not just Clery Act crimes.

Creating Your Log As with all aspects of Clery Act compliance, documentation is vital. Begin by clearly identifying your log as a Daily Crime Log. One method of formatting a crime log is shown in the following example. Figure 6.

You may use either military time , as shown in the sample log, or standard time. The Nature of the Crime Enter a description of the reported criminal incident. This can be a brief description such as S imple Assault, or a more detailed description such as S imple Assaultnon-student victim involved in an encounter with a student offender. Use an easy-to-understand text definition as opposed to using a code, terms such as agency assist or initials for the crime. You can use state crime classifications (i.e., non -UCR classifications) for the crime log; however, usin g UCR classifications may help in ensuring that your institutions crime statistics are consistent with the reports in the crime log. If a crime is reported and entered into the crime log but the resulting investigation shows that the initial description w as inaccurate, you should update the description. Do not list the initially recorded crime as unfounded due to misclassification, or delete an entry once it has been made. Update the nature of the crime instead.

Enter the general location of the crime using a description that will mean something to the campus community, such as referring to North Campus Hall rather than in a dormitory. However, do not use a location that will lead to the identification of the victim such as Room 407, North Campus Hall. You may also use landmarks in describing a location. The Disposition of the Complaint, if Known Include the current status of each complaint in the log, if known; for example, pending, judicial referral or criminal arrest. Do not delete an entry once its been made; update the disposition instead. Again, anyone reading a log entry should be able to readily understand the information provided.

You may temporarily withhold information An entry, an addition to an entry or a change in the disposition of a complaint must be recorded within two business days of the reporting of the information to the campus police or the campus security department . Chapter 5. The Daily Crime Log: Recording Crimes Reported To Campus Police or Security Personnel The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 5-7 only if there is clear and convincing evidence that the release of information would jeopardize an ongoing investigation; jeopardize the safety of an individual; cause a suspect to flee or evade detection; or result in the destru ction of evidence. Your institution may withhold only that information that could cause a specifically identified adverse effect, and you must disclose such information once the adverse effect is no longer present. This means that if it is determined that information you would normally include in the crime log would cause a harmful effect, you may withhold that information temporarily until the information is no longer likely to prove harmful. The individual making the judgment to withhold information should document the reason for doing so. If your institution has a security department but not a campus police department we suggest that you consult with local law enforcement with regard to withholding crime log information. If a reported crime is fully inves tigated by sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel, and, based on the results of the investigation, they make a formal determination that the crime report is false or baseless, the log should indicate, as the disposition of the report, that the cri me is unfounded. Only sworn or commissioned law enforcement authorities that investigate the crime can make this determination. A campus security authority who is not a sworn or commissioned law enforcement authority cannot unfound a crime.

(See Chapter 3, under Unfounded Crimes, for a more detailed discussion of the process required to unfound a crime.) Making Your Log Available Your log must be accessible on-site. This means if you have an additional campus with a campus police or security department, a separate log must be available at, or accessible from, that campus as well. Format: Your log may be either hard copy or electronic. If your institution has an electronic log and there are technical problems that make it Chapter 5. The Daily Crime Log: Recording Crimes Reported To Campus Police or Security Personnel 5-8 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting unusable, use a hard copy log as a temporary replacement until the problems are resolved. Publicize Availability: Let students and employees know that the log is available, what it contains and where it is. You may post a notice on your website, in your security office, in your student and employee handbooks or anywhere else its likely to be seen. Accessibility: The crime log for the most recent 60-day period must be open to public inspection, free of charge, upon request, during normal business hours. You cannot require a written request. Anyone may have access to the log, whether or not they are associated with your institution. This includes the media. Make any portion of the log that is older than 60 days available within two business days of a request for public inspection. Entries in the crime log should be used, along with additional information, to gather the statistics that are required for inclusion in the annual security report and the annual Web-based data collectio n. Use only Clery Act crimes that occur in the geographic locations described in Chapter 2 of the handbook for this purpose. Archived logs should be kept for seven years in a location where they can be accessed if necessary. As noted above, members of the public may request to review past logs. You may be required to produce logs during a Department program review. (See Retaining Records in Chapter 9 for more information regarding records retention.) The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 6-1 Emergency Notification And Timely Warnings: Alerting Your Campus Community CHAPTER 6 Disclosure of emergency response and evacuation procedures citation 34 CFR 668.46( b)(13) The HEA has specific requirements intended to help you keep your students and employees informed about threats to their safety and health in a manner that allows them to protect themselves. This chapter discusses two different types of alerts and when and why you are required to issue them. The first part of the chapter provides a breakdown of the emergency response and evacuation procedures requirement. The second part discusses the timely warning requirement.

The first part of the chapter provides a breakdown of the emergency response and evacuation procedures requirement. The second part discusses the timely warning requirement. The third part describes the differences between an emergency notification and a timely warning , and provides sample scenarios to help you understand when its appropriate to use one or the other. Emergency Response and Evacuation Procedures The Clery Act requires every Title IV institution, without exception, to have and disclose emergency response and evacuation procedures that would be used in response to a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurri ng on the campus. (See Chapter 2 for a definition of on campus.) This requirement does not apply to emergency situations in or on noncampus buildings or property. If, however, your institution has emergency response and evacuation procedures for noncampus buildings or properties as well, make certain that your disclosures identify which procedures apply to your on-campus property and which apply to your noncampus buildings or properties. The emergency response and evacuation requirements are intended to ensure that your institution has sufficiently prepared for an emergency situation on campus, that you are testing these procedures to identify and improve any weaknesses and that you have considered how you will inform the campus community and other individuals, such as parents Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community 6-2 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting and guardians, in the event of an emergency. In other words, you must have an emergency plan, test it, evaluate it and publicize it . The Clery Act requires you to include a statement of policy regarding your emergency response and evacuation procedures in your annual security report along with your other security-related policy statements. (See Chapter 9 for a discussion on publishing and distributing the annual security report.) In developing and disclosing your procedures, be sure to address the who, what, when and how elements. For example, explain who makes decisions and initiates procedures, the procedure for reporting an emergency, when information is released, how information is provided, etc. There is no prescribed manner in which to present the information as long as its accurate, complete and understandable. You can use lists, flow charts, maps or other means to describe what you do in emergency situations. The important thing is that you say what you do and do what you say. When is an emergency notification necessary? Under the Clery Act , every institution is required to immediately notify the campus community upon confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation occurring on the campus that involves an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees. An immediate threat as used here includes an imminent or impending threat, such as an approaching for est fire, or a fire currently raging in one of your buildings.

An immediate threat as used here includes an imminent or impending threat, such as an approaching for est fire, or a fire currently raging in one of your buildings. Some other examples of significant emergencies or dangerous situations are outbreak of meningitis, norovirus or other serious illness; approaching tornado, hurricane or other extreme weather co nditions; earthquake; gas leak; terrorist incident; Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 6-3 armed intruder; bomb threat; civil unrest or rioting ; explosion; and nearby chemical or hazardous waste spill; Examples of situations that would not necessitate an emergency notification under the Clery Act : Power outage. Snow closure. String of larcenies. These are situations in which your institution might choose to alert the campus community; however, they do not meet the threshold of a significant emergency or dangerous situation for the purposes of this regulation. (If your institution has a policy that requires issuing an emergency alert for these or similar events, however, you must follow that poli cy.) Your emergency response and evacuation procedures statement must include items 14 below. Requirements for emergency response and evacuation procedures statement citation 34 CFR 668.46( g) 1. The pro cedures the institution will use to immediately notify the campus community upon the confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation inv olving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on the campus. What does this mean? Inherent in this requirement is a statement that your institution will immediately notify the campus community upon confirmation of an emergency or dangerous situation. Confirmation means that an institution official (or officials) has verified that a legitimate emergency or dangerous situation exists. Confirmation doesnt necessarily mean that all of the pertinent details are known or even available. Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community 6-4 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Provide a description of the procedures your institution will use in a significant emergency or a dangerous situation. You arent required to publish in great detail how your institution would respond to specific emergencies as this may compromise safety. For example, you can say that you will secure the residence halls without saying how you will do this, or you can say that students and employees will be directed to a saf e location, without naming the location. Include all of your procedures and describe them in a manner that lets the campus community and others know what you will do , and who or what office or organization will be responsible for each step along the way. Be sure to provide information about how an individual can report an emergency. The regulations dont require your institution to use a particular mode of communication.

Be sure to provide information about how an individual can report an emergency. The regulations dont require your institution to use a particular mode of communication. For example, in the case of a gas leak, your institution may determine that the most effective mode of communication is a fire alarm, whereas in other situations, it might be best to use a text message system. We encourage you to consider overlapping means of communication in case one method fails or malfunctions. Make a complete disclosur e of whatever methods will be used (or will potentially be used depending on the situation): a public address system, text messaging, e -mail messaging, electronic signboards, emergency phone lines, phone trees, bulletins posted on building entrances and ex its, etc. If any of the emergency notification services require the campus community to sign up, include specific information on how to do this. Institutions must ensure that notifications and warnings can be transmitted quickly to all students and employe es. Therefore, an institution would not be able to rely solely on a text messaging system if all members of the campus community are not required to participate in that system. Similarly, relying on an e-mail would not be adequate for institutions that do not establish an e-mail account for all students and employees, or require each member of the campus community to register an e-mail address with the institution. Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 6-5 Figure 7. Example of Emergency Notification via Text Message Note that you must describe y our procedures for both response and evacuation in emergency or dangerous situations. If you dont have a campus police or security department, or personnel trained in emergency management, we suggest that you consult with local law enforcement or emergency management personnel regarding how to appropriately design procedures for your institution. Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community 6-6 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2. A description of the process the institution will use to a. confirm that there is a significant emergency or dangerous situation as described in no. 1 above What does this mean? This part of your statement describes how your institution will confirm that there is an emergency or dangerous situation. Saying, for example, that the school will size up the situation to determine whether theres an emergency is not adequate. You have to describe the process your school will use. For example, is the director of your school solely responsible for confirming an emergency, or are there multi-layers of information gathering? If there are multiple people or offices involved, what is the relationship among them ? Do you rely on outside resources for certain types of emergencies or for all emergencies? How is this process coordinated? b. determine the appropriate segment or segments of the campus community", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 94, "word_count": 500}

If there are multiple people or offices involved, what is the relationship among them ? Do you rely on outside resources for certain types of emergencies or for all emergencies? How is this process coordinated? b. determine the appropriate segment or segments of the campus community to receive a notification What does this mean? You have the flexibility to alert only the segment of the population that you determine to be at risk. For example, in the case of a gas leak, you may choose to notify only individuals in the building that has the leak, whereas for a meningitis outbreak, you may choose to notify the entire campus community. Describe how you will make the decision to notify or not notify specific segments of the campus community. For example, you may state that the entire campus community will be notified when there is at least the pote ntial that a very large segment of the community will be affected by a situation, or when a situation threatens the operation of the campus as a whole. You may also indicate that there will be a continuing assessment of the situation and that additional segments of the campus community may be notified if a situation warrants such action. Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 6-7 c. determine the content of the notification What does this mean? Describe how your institution will determine what information will be contained in a notification. For example, you might state that your campus police department will determine how much information is appropriate to disseminate at different points in time. Depending on what segments of the community your notification targets, the content may differ. In the case of an approaching tornado, you may want to tell dorm residents to take shelter in the basement but you may want to tell commuter students to stay away from the campus. d. initiate the notification system What does this mean? Describe how your institution initiates notifying the campus community that theres an emergency or dangerous situation. For example, does your institution have first responders who are alerted before anyone else? Will you use fire alarms or public address systems to alert the campus community and follow up with text messages and posted bulletins as more specific information becomes available? Who is responsible for initiating the system? 3. A statement that the institution will, without delay, and taking into account the safety of the community, determine the content of the notification and initiate the notification system, unless issuing a notification will, in the professional judgment of r esponsible authorities, compromise efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to or otherwise mitigate the emergency.

Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community 6-8 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting begin the notification process. You also must state that the only reason your institution would not immediately issue a notification for a confirmed emergency or dangerous situation would be if doing so would compromise efforts to assist a victim; contain the emergency; respond to the e mergency ; or otherwise mitigate the emergency. The law doesnt specify who may or may not be a responsible authority except to qualify that they use professional judgment. Your institution is responsible for identifying these authorities. 4. A list of the titles of the person or persons or organization or organizations responsible for carrying out the actions described in nos. 2(a) through 2(d) above. What does this mean? Provide a list of individuals (by title or position) or organizations (by name) responsible for carrying out the procedures you describe in your annual security report. If different people or organizations will be responsible for different procedures or for responding to different types of emergency or dangerous situations, make this cle ar. For example, you might indicate that the local Public Health Department will be asked to confirm a serious virus outbreak. A campus located in a strip mall might call upon the mall security office to confirm a significant emergency situation. When designating individuals and organizations for your plan, avoid potential conflicts of responsibilities. For example, if the individual responsible for issuing an emergency notification is also responsible for containing the emergency, efforts to mitigate the emergency may be compromised. Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 6-9 5. The institution's procedures for disseminating emergency information to the larger community. What does this mean? This part of your statement addresses how your institution disseminates emergency information to individuals andor organizations outside of the campus community. You can use different methods to target different segments of the community. For example you might want to send cell phone alerts to your students parents and guardians, and use radio andor TV alerts for the neighboring community. If the procedures differ depending on the situation, explain this. Include information about who or what office is responsible for developing the information to be disclosed, and who or what office is responsible for disseminating the information to the larger community. 6.

You must conduct at least one test a year and you can choose to announce it or not. To comply with the Clery Act requirement the test must meet all of the criteria in the definition. It must be scheduled. You cannot say that an actual emergency situation or a false emergency alarm served as a test of your institutions procedures. contain drills. A drill is an activity that tests a single procedural operation (e.g., a test of initiating a cell phone alert system or a test of campus security personnel conducting a campus lockdown). contain exercises. An exercise is a test involving coordination of efforts (e.g., a test of the coordination of first responders, including police, firefighters and emergency medical technicians). Chapter 6.

A follow -through activity is an activity designed to review the test (e.g., a survey or interview to obtain feedback from participants). be designed for assessment of emergency plans and capabilities. This means that your test should have measureable goals. For example, Everyone involved in the emergency response and notification procedures will understand his or her role and responsibility . be designed for evaluation of emergency plans and capabilities. Design the test so that, using the assessments, you can judge whether or not the test met its goals. For example, The evacuation process accounted fordid not account for the diverse need s of all members of the campus community. You have flexibility in designing tests. For example, you may conduct a tabletop exercise (i.e., a simulated scenario) or conduct a live test. Whichever method you use, your test must address emergency response an d evacuation on a campuswide scale. Campuswide scale means that tests must address your plan for evacuating all of your campus buildings. This does not mean that your plan must involve evacuating the entire campus at once. Rather, it means you must have a plan for each building. We recognize that a shelter -in-place contingency might be the best procedure to use in certain circumstances when evacuation is not a reasonable option. b. publicizing its emergency response and evacuation procedures in conjunctio n with at least one test per calendar year What does this mean?

Another method might be informing parents and guardians that they can sign up for e- mail alerts. The alert can direct them to a website or radio station for details. c. documenting, for each test, a description of the exercise, the date, time and whether it was announced or unannounced What does this mean? This part of your statement describes how your institution will document each test. (Although the law requires only one test each year, if you have multiple tests in a year, youre required to document each one.) Be sure to address each component: A description of the exercise (i.e., the test). The date the test was held. The time the test started and ended. Whether the test was announced or unannounced. As with all other Clery Act -related documentation, your institution is required to keep emergency test documentation for seven years. Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community 6-12 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting The Timely Warning Timely warning citation 34 CFR 668.46( e) All of us want to be alerted promptly to potentially dangerous criminal situations near our homes or workplaces so that we have both the time and the information necessary to take appropriate precautions. Apply this to your institution, and you have the concept of the timely warning. The Clery Act requires you to alert the campus community to certain crimes in a manner that is timely and will aid in the prevention of similar crimes . Although the Clery Act doesnt define timely, the intent of a warning r egarding a criminal incident(s) is to enable people to protect themselves. This means that a warning should be issued as soon as pertinent information is available.

The warning should contain information about the type of criminal incident that has occurred, although you can provide additional information as it becomes available. Timely Warning Policy All Title IV institutions, without exception, are subject to the timely warning regulation. You are required to include in your annual security report a policy statement that accurately reflects your institutions current timely warning procedures (See Chapter 7 for more information about policy statements.) Crimes Subject to a Timely Warning You must issue a timely warning for all Clery Act crimes that occur on your Clery Act geography that are reported to campus security authorities or local police agencies; and considered by the institution to represent a serious or continuing threat to students and employees. The requirement for timely warnings is not limited to violent crimes or crimes against persons so you should not have a timely warning policy that contains this restriction. Timely warnings could be needed for crimes that represent threats to property. For example, its possible to have a rash of dormitory B urglaries or Motor Vehicle Thefts that merit a warning because they present a continuing threat to your A warning should be issued as soon as pertinent information is available. Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 6-13 campus community. A number of incidents involving the possession of date rape drugs may also trigge r the need for a warning. Your timely warning policy should not be limited to certain types of Clery Act crimes and it may include non -Clery Act crimes. That is, although the Clery Act mandates timely warnings only for Clery Act crimes, nothing in the law prohibits timely warnings for other crimes that may pose a serious or continuing threat to the campus community (e.g., a kidnapping on campus or a rash of robberies in a public parking lot across the street from the shopping plaza where your school is loca ted). If your policy states that you also will issue timely warnings for these or similar types of situations, you must follow that policy. Crimes Exempt From the Timely Warning Requirement Your institution is not required to provide a timely warning for non-Clery Act crimes or for crimes reported to a pastoral or professional counselor. (See Chapter 4 for definitions of pastoral and professional counselors.) There are no other exemptions. Making the Decision to Issue a Timely Warning Whether you issue a timely warning must be decided on a case-by-case basis in light of all the facts surrounding a crime, including factors such as the following: The nature of the crime. This means that you should consider the type of crime that was reported. Was it a Clery Act crime?

Did two students get drunk and attempt to steal a golf cart from the campus one night, or does it appear that professional car thieves are preying on your campus? The continuing danger to the campus community. This means that after a Clery Act crime is reported you should consider whether your students and employees are at risk of becoming victims of a similar crime. For example, if a R ape is reported on campus and the alleged perpetrator has not been caught, there is a risk of similar crimes. I f the alleged perpetrator was reported or apprehended, there may not be a continuing risk. However, you should still Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community 6-14 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting evaluate other factors such as whether the apprehended perpetrator had accomplices or had already set other attacks in motion. Does a criminal incident appear to be a one- time occurrence or does it fall into a pattern of reported crimes? For example, if your students set some posters on fire after your schools team lost the homecoming football game, the Arsons are probably a one-night event. If an unknown person is randomly setting fires on campus, there is a continuing threat. The possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts. This factor does not mean that in the event of a serious or continuing threat to your students or employees you should decide not to issue a timely warning. It means that the institution should consider the potential impact on various law enforcement operations as it issues these warnings. For example, you should warn students if there is a serial rapist preying on female joggers along the bike paths running through campus; you should not compromise law enforcement efforts by disclosing that two undercover female officers have been assigned to patrol the bike path. We recommend that your institution consult with campus security personnel andor local and state law enforcement authorities to discuss the timely warning requirement. We also recommend that your institution request that local law enforcement keep you informed on an immediate basis of crimes that may r equire timely warnings. This request may be made as part of your annual letter to law enforcement agencies requesting crime statistics. (See Chapter 4 for more information about this letter.) Institutions cannot outsource the requirement to issue timely warnings to local law enforcement agencies and must not enter into agreements that prohibit the issuance of such warnings.

You must include pertinent information about the crime that triggered the warning. Your institutions policy regarding timely warnings should specify what types of information will be included. Issuing a Timely Warning Although there is no required format for a timely warning, the warning must be reasonably likely to r each the entire campus community . Therefore, timely warnings must be issued in a manner that gets the word out quickly and effectively communitywide. The warning may be e- mailed, posted around campus, provided as a text message or otherwise distributed acc ording to your institutions policy. A combination of dissemination methods may be used. Timely warnings may not be issued in a manner or posted in a location that requires the campus community to make requests for them or to search for them. The responsibility for getting the warning out rests solely with the institution. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Timely Warning Requirement FERPA and the Timely Warning citation 34 CFR 99.31(b)(6) and 99.36 An institution may, in app ropriate circumstances , include personally identifiable information in a timely warning. Although personally identifiable information is generally protected from disclosure under FERPA, such information may be released in an emergency situation. The Depart ments FERPA regulations, at 34 CFR 99.36, describe the rule relating to the disclosure of information in health and safety emergencies. Chapter 6.

Issue a timely warning for any Clery Act crime committed on your Clery Act geography that is reported to your campus security authorities or a local law enforcement agency, and that is considered by the institution to represent a serious or continuing threat to students and employees. Where: Applies to crimes that occur anywhere on your Clery Act geography. When: Issue a warning as soon as the pertinent information is available. Chapter 6. Emergency Notification and Timely Warning: Alerting Your Campus Community The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 6-17 The Departments regulations specify that an institution that follows its emergency notification procedures is not required to issue a timely warning based on the same circumstances; however, the institution must provide adequate follow-up information to the community as needed. Consider the following scenarios and whether a timely warning is warranted. Figure 8. Sample Scenarios Regarding Emergency Notification and the Timely Warning Scenario 1: In a single night there are several random Arsons in unoccupied classrooms and basements of buildings on campus. Upon confirmation that there is an arsonist on campus, you follow your emergency notification procedures. There is no need to issue a timely warning for the A rsons as well. As soon as its available, disseminate pertinent follow-up information to the campus community. Scenario 2: An employee spots an armed intruder in a classroom building. The employee alerts a campus polic e officer who is present in the building and who confirms the situation. Following your emergency notification procedures, the officer alerts the campus police chief who initiates campus -wide emergency notification procedures. In the course of trying to apprehend the intruder, the intruder shoots and wounds two people trying to flee the building. Although emergency notification procedures were initiated, the circumstances have changed, and you must issue a timely warning for the shootings (i.e., the crimes of Aggravated A ssault).

The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 7-1 Policy Statements: What You Do and How You Do It CHAPTER 7 Annual security report policy statements citation 34 CFR 668.46( b) A major requirement of the Clery Act is to disclose policy statements in your annual security report. Due to the number and nature of the statements, this handbook devotes two chapters to the subject. This chapter focuses on policies regarding how students and others should report crimes or other emergencies occurring on campus; security of and access to campus facilities; crime prevention; campus law enforcement and security; and alcohol and drugs. Chapter 8 discusses policies, procedures and programs regarding dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking; and obtaining registered sex offender information.

Chapter 8 discusses policies, procedures and programs regarding dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking; and obtaining registered sex offender information. Regardless of which policy youre addressing there are some general guidelines to keep in mind: Language. Use language that will be understood by the general public (i.e., avoid heavily legal language). Accuracy. Your statements or descriptions of policies must accurately reflect your institutions current procedures and practices . If your institution does not have a policy or program responding to one or more of the categories listed in the regulations, you must disclose this fact. If you are compiling security reports for multiple campuses , If you are compiling security reports for multiple campuses, make sure your policy statements accurately reflect the current policies and practices of each separate campus. Chapter 7. Policy Statements: Disclosing What You Do And How You Do It 7-2 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting make sure your policy statements accurately reflect the current policies and practices of each separate campus. Do not just repeat your policy statements from year to year; make sure that the statement s of policy actually reflect your institutions procedures and practices. Required components. Pay close attention to the requirements of each policy statement. Include detailed information that addresses each part of the requirement. In general, the law does not prescribe policies and procedures for schools to follow; however, the law and the regulations set minimum requirements for specific information that must be addressed in your institutions annual security report. Missing policies. Failure to have a required policy or to disclose all of the required policy statements means that your school is not in compliance with the law. As always, please consult our Campus Safety and Security Help Desk if you have questions that are not answered by the policy chapters in this handbook. The required policy statements are presented in the following section. Where applicable, t he statements are broken down into components to emphasize the content you must include. Explanations of statements are preceded by What does this mean? Your institutions policy statements must reflect your institutions unique security policies, procedures and practices. You may present your policy statements in any order. You may also combine statements as long as they are clearly labeled. For example, if your institution has a combined alcohol and drug policy, you may identify it as a combined policy and present it that way. Campus Security Policies That Must Be Addressed in the Annual Security Report 1. Provide a statement of current campus policies regarding procedures for students and others to report criminal actions or other emergencies occurring on campus.

The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 8-1 Policies, Procedures and Programs: Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Stalking CHAPTER 8 As mentioned in Chapter 7, the Clery Act requires you to include statements of policy in your annual security report that address your institutions programs to prevent dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, and the procedures your institution will follow when one of these crimes is reported. The regulations include some requirements for these programs but institutions have some discretion in the specifics of thei r statements and in how the policies and procedures are put into practice. This chapter breaks down the statements components and indicates which aspects and procedures are required and where you have flexibility.

For purposes of the Clery Act , dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking are defined in the Departments regulations. Dating violence is defined as violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the reporting partys statement and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. For the purposes of this definition Chapter 8. Policies, Procedures, and Programs: Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking 8-2 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting dating violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse. dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence. Domestic Violence is defined as a felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim. by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common. by a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the victim as a spouse or intimate partner. by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred; by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that persons acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred. Stalking is defined as engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for the persons safety or the safety of others; or suffer substantial emotional distress. Sexual A ssault is defined as an offense that meets the definition of R ape, Fondling, Incest or S tatutory Rape as used in the FBIs UCR program and included in Appendix A of 34 CFR Part 668. With these definitions in mind, your statement must address your institutions programs to prevent dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, and the procedures your institution will follow when one of these Chapter 8.

The statement must include a description of the institutions primary prevention and awareness programs for all incoming students and new employees. What does this mean? Your statement must describe the programs you have in place to promote awareness and to educate people about preventing dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. We encourage institutions to reach out to organizations that assist victims of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, such as local rape crisis centers, local law enforcement officials, social services personnel, and State and territorial coalitions against domestic and sexual violence, when developi ng these programs. Programs to prevent dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking are defined as comprehensive, intentional and integrated programming, initiatives, strategies and campaigns intended to end dating violence, domestic vi olence, sexual assault and stalking that are culturally relevant, inclusive of diverse communities and identities, sustainable, responsive to community needs, informed by research or assessed for value, effectiveness or outcome, and Chapter 8.

The programs you implement at your institution must be tailored to your institutions community and the needs of your students and employees. The programs must be culturally relevant and inclusive of, and responsive to, all parts of your community. The programs must also be informed by research. Informed by research includes research conducted according to scientific standards as well as assessments for efficacy carried out by institutions and other organizations. This does not preclude you from using promising practices that have been assessed by members of your institution, or other institutions, for value, effectiveness or outcome but not yet subjected to scientific review. Programs to prevent dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking must include primary prevention and awareness programs. Primary prevention programs are defined as programming, initiatives and strategies intended to stop dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking before they occur through the promotion of positive and healthy behaviors that foster healthy, mutually respectful relationships and sexuality, encourage safe bystander intervention, and seek to change behavior and social norms in healthy and safe directions. Examples of these programs might include programs that promote good listening and communication skills, moderation in alcohol consumption and common courtesy.

Programs to prevent dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking must be directed at all incoming students and new employees. The statute and regulations do not require that all students and employees take or attend the training, but we encourage institutions to mandate training to increase its effectiveness.

This means providing all incoming students and new employees with active notification of the trainings availability, and providing the training in a format and timeframe that encourages and allows for maximum participation. Institutions may choose how to deliver the programming to students and employees; for example, you could use in-person interactive workshops, theater performances, presentations or videos with follow-up discussion, webinars, online videos, online interactive training, etc. You may also use multiple means of delivery for a multi-pronged approach. The means of the training should fit the circumstances of your community. If you have a commuter campus it would make sense to provide online training that can be accessed on a student or employees own time. In the case of a commuter campus, an in-person training session offered only once per year would most likely not be considered a good faith effort to reach all incoming students and new employees. You can combine one or more of the required elements (e.g., primary prevention, awareness, bystander intervention and risk reduction) into a single training, as long as the training meets all of the requirements. You are not required to conduct separate trainings on each topic. You are also not prohibited from addressing behaviors or concerns outside of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking in t he training. For example, the bystander intervention training principles described below can be extended to other types of behavior.

In addition to the primary prevention and awareness programs provided to incoming students and new employees, you must also provide ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns for all current students and employees. Ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns means programming, initiatives and strategies that are sustained over time. The programming, initiative s and strategies must also focus on increasing the understanding of topics relevant to and skills for addressing dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, using a range of strategies with audiences throughout the institution.

This part of your statement addresses what students should do in the case of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking. Institutions must provide written information to victims about the importance of preserving evidence that may assist in proving that the alleged criminal offense occurred or that may be helpful in obtaining a protection order. Although not required, we recommend that institutions p rovide information about where to obtain forensic examinations, include specific contact information , make clear that completing a forensic examination would not require someone to file a police report, and advise students that having a forensic examination will help preserve evidence in case the victim decides at a later date to file a police report. how and to whom the alleged offense should be reported; What does this mean?

What does this mean? This part of your statement addresses how you will protect a victims confidentiality, even if the victim does not specifically request confidentiality. First, you must disclose your procedures for ensuring that the victims personally identifying information will not be included in any publicly available recordkeeping, including Clery Act reporting and disclosures such as the annual s ecurity report and the daily crime log. Personally identifying information is defined in Section 40002(a) of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 as individually identifying information for or about an individual, including information likely to disclose the location of a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, regardless of whether the information is encoded, encrypted, hashed or otherwise protected, including a first and last name; a home or other physical address; Chapter 8.

CSA crime reports should include sufficient detail such as dates and locations and, where appropriate, personally identifying information , including name and contact information if available. This is important for law enforcement purposes to ensure that all crimes are counted and to avoid double counting crimes. The Clery Act statistics that are included in the Annual Security Report must not include any personally identifying information about the individuals involved in the crimes reflected in the statistics. In addition, no personally identifying information should be disclosed in the Daily Crime Log, as detailed in Chapter 5. Institutions must protect a victims confidentiality while also recognizing that, in some cases, an institution may need to disclose s ome information about a victim to a third party to provide necessary accommodations or protective measures. Your policy should state who is responsible for determining what information about a victim should be disclosed and to whom this information will be disclosed.

Provide information about how a student or employee can access these services or request information. Provide specific contact information. Be sure to include both on- and off- campus services, as applicable. We recommend that institutions reach out to organizations that assist victims of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, such as local rape crisis centers and state and territorial coalitions against domestic and sexual violence, when developing this list of services.

Protective measures should minimize the burden on the victim. For example , if the complainant and alleged perpetrator share the same class or residence hall, the school should not, as a matter of course, remove the victim from the class or housing while allowing the alleged perpetrator to remain without carefully considering the facts of the case. g. a clear statement of policy that addresses the procedures for institutional disciplinary action in cases of alleged dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking and that describes each type of disciplinary proceeding used by the institution; the steps, anticipated timelines, and decision -making process for each type of disciplinary proceeding; how to file a disciplinary complaint; and how the institution determines which type of proceeding to use based on the circumstances of an allegation of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking; What does this mean? Procedures for institutional disciplinary action citation 34 CFR 668.46( k) Proce eding is defined as all activities related to a non-criminal resolution of an institutional disciplinary complaint, including, but not limited to, factfinding investigations, formal or informal meetings, and hearings. Proceeding does not include communications and meetings between officials and victims concerning accommodations or protective measures to be provided to a victim. In this statement you must disclose all of your institutions procedures for campus disciplinary action in cases of alleged dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.

Provide contact information for the person or office to which the complaint should be made, the location of any forms required, and the options for filing the complaint (i.e., in - person, electronically, by phone). Also, describe how your institution decides which type of proceeding will be used for which cases and who makes that decision (i.e., do sexual assaults automatically get assigned a formal hearing).

Different legal proceedings may have different standards of evidence. The most common standards are preponderance of the evidence, clear and convincing evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt. The Clery Act does not require a specific standard of evidence. However, the Clery Act does require that each institution choose which standard of evidence they will use in their disciplinary proceedings arising from allegations of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, and describe that standard in this statement. The institution must use the standard of evidence described in the state ment in all such proceedings. Chapter 8. Policies, Procedures, and Programs: Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 8-17 lists all the possible sanctions that the institution may impose following the results of any institutional disciplinary proceeding for an allegation of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking; What does this mean? The Clery Act does not specify the sanctions an institution may impose. An institution must determine which sanctions it may impose for each of the VAWA offenses and list all of the possible sanctions in this statement. An institution may have different potential sanct ions for different crimes. For example, the possible sanctions for an allegation of stalking may be very different from the possible sanctions for an allegation of sexual assault. In this statement, you must list all of the possible sanctions you have identified for each VAWA Offense. Be specific. For example, if suspension is a possible sanction, describe the type and length of the suspension, and any requirements that must be met for reinstatement.

Policies, Procedures, and Programs: Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking 8-18 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting provides that the proceedings will include a prompt, fair and impartial process from the initial investigation to the final result; What does this mean? A prompt, fair and impartial proceeding is defined as a proceeding that is completed within reasonably prompt timeframes designated by the institutions policy, including a process that allows for the extension of timeframes for good cause, with written notice to the accuser and the accused of the delay and the reason for the delay; conducted in a manner that is consistent with the institutions policies and transparent to the accuser and the accused; includes timely notice of meetings at which the accuser or accused, or both, may be present; and provides timely and equal access to the accuser, the accused and appropriate officials to any information that will be used during informal and formal disciplinary meetings and hearings; and conducted by officials who do not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against the accuser or the accused. Earlier we explained that institutions must describe the steps and timeframes involved in their disciplinary proceedings. This statement requires that those policies be followed and also remain flexible without allowing und ue delays. The proceeding must be one that lacks hidden agendas and conditions, makes appropriate information available to each party, and is fair and clear to all parties. Care should be taken to ensure that the official conducting a disciplinary proceeding does not have a conflict of interest or bias either for or against the accuser or the accused. Chapter 8.

Your statement must describe this training. It is important that this training be updated as necessary to address the latest issues and techniques for conducting proceedings on these topics from beginning to end. Training for these officials should address but not be limited to the following topics: relevant evidence and ho w it should be used during a proceeding; proper techniques for questioning witnesses; basic procedural rules for conducting a proceeding; and avoiding actual and perceived conflicts of interest. This training may be delivered in person or by electronic means, such as a webinar or video. Since different officials may conduct different parts of the proceedings, it is not necessary for every official to receive every part of the training. For example, if certain officials conduct only the initial investiga tion, they do not need to receive training on how to conduct a hearing. However, institutions may train all selected officials on all related topics. The officials who are chosen to conduct proceedings to address allegations of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking must receive training at least once a year. Chapter 8.

You must state that both the accuser and the accused will be provided with the same opportunities to be accompanied by an advisor of their choice. This requirement is not limited to students. Employees must be provided with the same opportunities. An advisor is any individual who provides the accuser or accused support, guidance or advice . Institutions are prohibited from limiting the choice of advisor, or an advisors presence for either the accuser or the accused , in any meeting or institutional disciplinary proceeding . Institutions may form a pool of individuals, including members of the campus community, who may serve as advisors as long as the choice of advisor by the accused or the accuser is not limited to such a pool.

Institutions are not required to permit an advisor to attend without the advisee but may find that permitting an advisor to attend alone with the advisees agreement will make it easier to arrange procedural meetings. Similarly, the regulations do not prohibit the advisor from acting as a proxy for either the accused or the accuser in the interest of protecting the parties privacy. In such case, the accuser or the accused would need to authorize their advisor to serve as a proxy and consent to any disclosures of their records. Institutions are not required to cancel or delay meetings s imply because an advisor could not be present as long as the institution gave proper notice of the meeting.

While institutions may not limit an accused or accusers choice of advisor, they may restrict the advisors role, such as prohibiting the advisor from speaking during the proceeding, addressing the disciplinary tribunal or questioning witnesses. Institutions may remove or dismiss advisors who become disruptive or who do not abide by the restrictions on their participation.

In explaining the rationale for the result and sanctions, the official or entity must explain how it weighted the evidence and information presented during the proceeding, and explain how the evidence and information support the result and sanctions. You must describe how the institutions standard of evidence was appli ed. It is not sufficient to say only that the evidence presented either met or did not meet the institutions standard of evidence. This means that there can be no substantive discussion of the findings or conclusion of the decision maker, or discussion of the sanctions imposed, with either the accuser or the accused prior to simultaneous notification to both of the result. h. a statement that, when a student or employee reports to the institution that the student or employee has been a victim of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, whether the offense occurred on or off campus, the institution will provide the student or employee a written explanation of the students or employees rights and options.

Your institution is not required to request this information from the state; rather, the state must provide this information to the campus police department or ot her law enforcement authorities in your schools jurisdiction. In turn, your institution is required to advise the campus community how to access this information . The law doesnt, however, require you to disseminate additional information about the offenders. You are responsible for notifying the campus community if there is a change in how the data can be obtained. For example, if you were directing people to a local law enforcement agency for information and the agency tells you that they are now using a website to maintain the data, you must then provide the URL for the site to the campus community. If the state in which your institution is located does not currently register sex offenders, or does not provide campus police or your local law enforcement agency with this information, include a statement to this effect in your annual security report. However, you would be required to advise the campus community about obtaining registered sex offender information should the state provide it at a future date. This page intentionally left blank.

Presenting Your Policy Statements in the Annual Security Report Disclosure of policy statements in annual security report citation 34 CFR 668.46(b)(2) (14) As you compile the section on policy statements, keep the focus of the requirement in mind: disclosure of the procedures, practices and programs your institution uses to keep students and employees safe and its facilities secure. Present your statements in an accurate, concise, readable and organized manner. The required policy statements are discussed in detail in chapters 7 and 8. They may precede or follow the crime statistics in your report. Presenting General Crime Statistics and Arrest and Disciplinary Referral Statistics Disclosure of crime statistics in annual security report citation 34 CFR 668.46(b)(1) Present all s tatistics other than those for H ate Crimes and unfounded crimes in a tabular format. This means that all Criminal Offenses, VAWA Offenses, and a rrests and referrals for disciplinary action for Weapons, D rug Abuse and Liquor Law Violations should be presented in a table or tables. Use clear and consistent labeling to make the information pr esented easy to read. Include caveats as necessary to explain the data in the table. For example, if your institution housed students in an on-campus dormitory for the first time last year, it would be helpful to provide a caveat explaining why crime stati stics for the on-campus student housing facilities category are included for only the most recent year. If you are including non- Clery Act statistics in your annual security report Chapter 9.

Distributing the Annual Security Report Who gets the annual security report? You must distribute the report to all currently enrolled students (including those attending less than full-time and those not enrolled in Title IV programs or courses) and all employees by Oct. 1 each year. You also must provide the report to any prospective student or prospective employee upon request. A prospective student is defined as an individual who has contacted an eligible institution requesting information about admission to that institution. A prospective employee is defined as an individual who has contacted an eligible institution requesting information concerning employment with that institution. Chapter 9. The Annual Security Report: Publishing Policy Statements and Crime Statistics 9-8 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting If you have students who are enrolled in your institution but who are currently taking courses at another school or who are not taking courses but are completing thesis or dissertation work, you are still required to provide them with your annual security report. How should the report be distributed? You must distribute the report to all enrolled students and current employees in one of two ways: 1. Directly by publications and mailings. You may give a copy of your annual security report directly to each individual or by direct mailing the report to each individual through the United States Postal Service or any other direct mail service (i.e. Federal Express); campus mail; e-mail; or a combination of these methods. 2. Posting the annual security report on an Internet or intranet website that is reasonably accessible to enrolled students and to current employees. You may use this method only if you distribute an individual notice about the annual security report to each student and employee by Oct. 1. Do not bury the notice in another document where a student or employee may be unlikely to read it. The notice should include a statement of the reports availability. a list and brief description of the information contained in the report. the exact address (URL) of the Internet or intranet website at which the report is posted. This means that you must provide a direct link to the annual security report. It is not acceptable simply to give the URL for the institutions website. Chapter 9.

This request does not have to be made in writing. You may not charge fees to individuals for copies of the annual security report, nor can you include the annual security report in any publication for which you charge a fee. Important note for institutions with on- campus student housing facilities: If your institution has any on-campus student housing facilities you must also publish an annual fire safety report as described in Chapter 14. You may publish both reports together as long as the title of the document clearly states that it contains both the annual security report and the annual fire safety report. If you choose to publish the two reports separately, you must include information in each of the two reports about how to directly access the other report. Do not simply state that the other report is available. Providing the Annual Security Report to Prospective Students and Employees As stated previously, you must also make the report available to prospective students and employees. Do this by providing prospective students and prospective employees with a notice containing a statement of the reports availability; a description of its contents; and the opportunity to request a copy. You may provide this notice to prospective students and prospective employees along with other information your institution provides to them. If your institution solicits applications for a faculty or an adminstrative position through an advertisement, the institution is required to provide a notice of the availability of the annual security report to those Chapter 9. The Annual Security Report: Publishing Policy Statements and Crime Statistics 9-10 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting individuals it interviews. However, you are not required to include notification in the job advertisement, nor are you required to notify an individual to whom you simply sent a rejection letter based on his or her unsolicited employment application. If you choose to provide your annual security report to prospective students and prospective employees by posting the report on an Internet site, the notice provided to each individual must include the exact URL for where the report is posted; a brief description of the report; and a statement that the institution will provide a paper copy of the report upon request. Note that you may not use an intranet site to make disclosures to prospective students and employees. Correcting the Annual Security Report If your institution makes corrections to your statistical disclosures or changes its safety and security policies at any time after publishing your annua l security report for a particular year (no later than Oct. 1), you must update your annual security report.

If your institution makes changes to its safety and security policies, you must update the information in your most recent annual security report to reflect your new policies. The statements or descriptions in your annual security report must accurately reflect your institutions current procedures and practices. When a change is made to the statistics or policies in an annual security report, you should add a note to the annual security report explaining the change. This note should include Chapter 9. The Annual Security Report: Publishing Policy Statements and Crime Statistics The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 9-11 what change was made, the date the change was made and the reasons for the change. Once revised, you must redistribute the annual security report following the notification procedures described in Distributing the Annual Security Report. If you post the revised ann ual security report online, you must distribute a notice about the availability of a revised annual security report to each student and employee. Retaining Records Be sure to retain the annual security report and all supporting records used in compiling the report for three years from the latest publication of the report to which they apply. For example, the 2015 annual security report should contain statistics for 2 012, 2013 and 2014. The 2012 statistics and supporting records must be kept until Oct. 1, 2018in effect, seven years. Records to be kept include, but are not limited to, the following : copies of crime reports; the daily crime logs; records for arrests an d referrals for disciplinary action; timely warning and emergency notification reports; documentation, such as letters to and from local police having to do with Clery Act compliance; letters to and from campus security authorities; correspondence with us regarding Clery Act compliance; and copies of notices to students and employees about the availability of the annual security report. Make sure to date all documentation, and ensure it is easily retrievable. If you scan paper documents for archival purposes, be sure to scan the complete document. We suggest that you have more than one person at your school who knows where the documentation is kept.

Note that if your institution became Title IV eligible after Jan. 31, your institution is exempt from participating in the Web-based data collection (i.e., the Campus Safety and Security Survey) for the calendar year in which you became eligible. The regulations require you to disclose crime and fire statistics each year for the previous three years. 5 However, if, for example, your institution became Title IV eligible in July 2014, you would not have collected any HEA crime and fire statistics prior to that date. Because the online survey collects statistics for an entire calendar year, your institutio n would not participate in the survey until you had an entire year of statistics. In this case, you would participate in the 2016 survey for the collection of 2015 statistics. 5 Only schools that have on -campus student housing facilities must disclose fire statis tics. Chapter 9.

The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 10-1 Missing Students: The Twenty -four Hour Rule CHAPTER 10 Missing student notification policy disclosure citation 34 CFR 668.46( b)(14) If your institution has any on-campus student housing facilities, you are required to comply with the Departments missing student notification regulations. (Please see Definition of an On-campus Student Housing Facility in Chapter 2.) The Departments missing student regulations relate only to students who reside in on-campus housing. They do not address students living in any noncampus student housing your institution owns or controls. If you have multiple campuses , you have to comply with these regulations only at those that have on-campus student housing facilities. If your institution has any foreign campuses with on-campus student housing facilities, those campuses also must comply with missing student notification regulations. Note that these regulations do not address students who are residing off campus while attending study abroad programs. Your institution must issue a policy statement that addresses missing student notification for students residing in on-campus student housing; and include procedures that your institution will follow if any of those students is determined to be missing for 24 hours. The essence of the requirement is that if a student who lives in on-campus student housing is determined to have been missing for 24 hours, you have only 24 hours after receiving this information in which to initiate specific notification procedures. This requirement does not preclude your institution from making a determination that a student is missing before the student has been missing for a full 24 hours, or from initiating notification procedures as soon as it determines that the student is missing. In other words, you must initiate HEA-related procedures if a student has been determined to be missing for 24 hours; however, you may act sooner.

The Departments missing student regulations relate only to students who reside in on - campus housing. Chapter 10. Missing Students: The Twenty -four Hour Rule 10-2 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Include your policy and procedures statement in your institutions annual security report. You can include it with your institutions other campus security policy statements, in any order that you choose. Make sure that you clearly state that this policy focuses only on students residing in on- campus student housing. If your institution has a policy that applies to all missing students regardless of whether they live on campus or off campus, you may issue a single missing student policy statement providing it fully and clearly addresses each of the required HEA components for students living in on- campus housing. Policy Statement Requirements for missing stude nt notification policy statement citation 34 CFR 668.46( h) Your missing student policy statement must 1. indicate a list of titles of the persons or organizations to which students, employees or other individuals should report that a stude nt has been missing for 24 hours; What does this mean? You must provide a list of individuals or organizations that people should contact if they have reason to believe a student who lives in on-campus student housing has been missing from campus for 24 hours. Use complete titles, such as dean of housing rather than the dean, and City of Rockville Police Department rather than the police. Include contact information for each listing. 2. require that any missing student report must be referred immediately to the institution's police or campus security department, or, in the absence of an institutional police or campus security department, to the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the area ; What does this mean? This component addresses what your institution is obligated to do when a missing student report is received from anyone, even individuals not affiliated with your school. If your institution has a campus police or security department, your policy must state that anyone receiving a Chapter 10. Missing Students: The Twenty -four Hour Rule The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 10-3 missing student report should immediately bring it to that departments attention.

This component addresses your institutions obligation to advise every student who lives in on-campus student housing, regardless of age, that he or she may register one or more individuals to be a contact strictly for missing persons purposes . The contact person can be anyone. You must gi ve students this option even if they have already identified a general emergency contact. A student may identify the same individual for both purposes, but your institution may not assume that a general emergency contact is also the missing person contact. Offer students this option annually regardless of whether they chose to register a contact the previous year. If any students move into on-campus student housing mid- year, you must give them the option to name a contact person as well. Include in your policy statement information about how a student can register a contact or contacts . Chapter 10. Missing Students: The Twenty -four Hour Rule 10-4 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 4. advise students that their contact information will be registered confidentially, that this information will be accessible only to authorized campus officials, and that it may not be disclosed, except to law enforcement personnel in furtherance of a missing person investigation; What does this mean? This component addresses how a students contact person information will be maintained and who is allowed access to it. Inform students that the information will be kept confidential. To protect confidentiality, general emergency contact information and missing student contact information must be kept separate, even if the student has registered the same person for both purposes. Because the HEA requires the information to be kept confidential, students contact information has greater privacy protections than the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) provides. State that contact information may be accessed only by authorized campus officials. Although your policy statement does not have to contain the names or titles of the authorized officials, you should document this information for your records. Those officials may disclose the contact information only to law enforcement officials and only for the purpose of a missing student investigation.

If your institution is unsuccessful in contacting the named individual or individuals, document your attempts. The official determination that the student is missing can be made at any time by the campus police or security department (if the campus has one) or by the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction where the campus is located. For example, suppose a student goes to your campus security office at 10 a.m. on a Monday and reports that a student living in her dorm left the campus at 9 p.m. Sunday and didnt return for her Monday 8 a.m. class. The student has been missing for 11 hours. Campus security investigates and comes to the conclusion at 11:15 a.m. that the student is missing. If the missing student has identified a con fidential contact, campus security has 24 hours (i.e., until 11:15 a.m. Tuesday) to notify that contact person. 2. If the student is under 18 years of age and is not emancipated, notifying the student's custodial parent or guardian and any other designate d contact person within 24 hours that the student is missing. What does this mean? These procedures address students under 18 who are not legally independent of their parents. If its determined that such a student has been missing for 24 hours, the institution has only 24 hours in which to contact (in no required order) the custodial parent or guardian; and The confidential contact person, if the student has identified one. These regulations do not preclude the institution from contacting the student's contact person or the custodial parent or guardian immediately upon determination that the student is missing. Chapter 10. Missing Students: The Twenty -four Hour Rule The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 10-7 3.

You must state that your institution will notify the local law enforcement agency when any student who lives in on- campus stu dent housing has been determined to be missing for 24 hours. You must do this even if your school has a campus police or security department. Note that this procedure differs from no. 2 under the Policy Statement section , which requires missing student reports to be forwarded to a local law enforcement agency if your school does not have a campus police or security department. Procedure no. 3 directly above, requires your institution to forward the information that a student has been determined to be missing. This page intentionally left blank. The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 11-1 Fire Safety Disclosures: Requirements and Definition Of a Fire CHAPTER 11 Institutional fire safety regulations citation 34 CFR 668. 49 The HEA fire safety regulations apply only to institutions with on-campus student housing facilities and focus exclusively on those facilities. (See Definition of an On - campus Student Housing Facility in Chapter 2.) The regulations do not apply to other buildings on your campus or to any noncampus student housing facilities your institution might own or control. If you have multiple campuses , you must comply with the regulations only at those that have on-campus student housing facilities. If your institution has any foreign campuses with on-campus student housing facilities, you must comply with the HEA fire safety regulations at those campuses. An institution with on -campus student housing facilities is required to maintain a log of all reported fires that occur in those on-campus student housing facilities; publish an annual fire safety report that contains fire safety policies and fire statistics for each of those facilities; and submit the fire statistics from the fire safety report annually to the Department. The fire log is discussed in Chapter 12, fire statistics are discussed in C hapter 13 and the annual fire safety report is discussed in Chapter 14. First, though, to comply fully and accurately with the requirements found in those chapters, you need to understand how to define a fire for the purposes of the HEA.

Note that if there is a vehicle fire (i.e., a fire that is confined to a vehicle) in a student housing facility parking garage, this is not a student housing facility fire. However, if there is a fire in the g arage that spreads to a vehicle, or if a vehicle fire spreads to the garage, this is a student housing facility fire. fires reported to any official at your institution (e.g., to a residence life officer), not just campus fire authorities or campus secur ity authorities.

Fire Safety Disclosures: Requirements and Definition of a Fire 11-4 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting incidents that violate your institutions fire safety policies but that do not meet the definition of a fire. For example, if your institution prohibits fires in fireplaces in on -campus student housing and a student lights a fire in the fireplace, this is not a reportable fire under the HEA. However, if the fire began burning in an uncontrol lable manner and ignited the chimney or flue, that would be a reportable fire. The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 12-1 The Fire Log: Recording Fires in On -campus Student Housing Facilities CHAPTER 12 Fire log citation 34 CFR 668. 49(d) Your institution must maintain a written, easily understood fire log that records, by the date reported, any fire that occurs in an on- campus student housing facility. You are not required to record fires that occur anywhere else on your campus in this log. Nor are you required to record fires that occur in any noncampus student housing that your school might own or control. You may, however, include other fires in the log for your institutions internal record keeping and for making the information available to the public . You may maintain the log in a hard copy or in an electronic format. Either format must be accessible to the campus community on-site. This means that if you have separate campuses that have on -campus student housing facilities, a fire log must be available at, or accessible from, each campus. Information from the log should be used in calculating the statistics to include in the annual fire safety report and the fire statistics submitted to the Department. These statistics must also be disclosed to your students and employees , and prospective students and employees. What Are Reported Fires? Reported fires include fires that were already extinguished as well as those discovered while still burning. They include emergency situations involving fires that necessitated a call to 911 for fire department assistance, as well as minor fires, such as a small trash can fire that was easily extinguished without assistance. Fires can be reported by anyone, regardless of the individuals association with your institution. Unlike Clery Act crime reporting, in which a crime is reported when it is brought to the attention of a campus security authority or a local law enforcement agency, there are no such restrictions with fire reporting.

To help ensure that fire reports get entered into your fire log, your institution must have and disclose a policy and procedures informing students and employees of the individuals or organizations to whom fires should be reported. (More about this in Chapter 14.) Figure 14. Examples of Reported Fires Scenario 1: A student calls a resident assistant from his cell phone to report a small fire in a dorm laundry room. When the RA gets to the laundry room there is no evidence or indication of a fire. He asks the student who made the report where the fire was and the student tells him that a paper had been set on fire on the bulletin board by someone on his way out of the room. The student extinguished the burning paper immediately and then called the RA. The RA must document the report and forward it to the office maintaining the log for entry in the fire log. Scenario 2: A maintenance worker is repairing a kitchen sink at a Greek house on campus. He notices that the stove is scorched and asks a couple of students what happened. They tell him that several months ago they had a fire while making dinner. The maintenance worker asks the students if they reported the fire and they tell him that they didnt becaus e they were able to extinguish it themselves. The maintenance worker forwards the report to the office maintaining the log for entry into the fire log. Scenario 3: The city of College Parks fire department responds to an active fire alarm set off by a sm oke detector in a student dormitory on campus. Fire personnel investigate but do not find evidence of a fire. The fire department determines that workmen using power tools to repair a bathroom fan set off the smoke detector. They call the schools security department to report their findings. The security department documents the report in the departments incident log but does not enter it into the fire log.

Although not required to enter this fire in the fire log because it occurred outside of an on-campus student housing facility, the school decides to enter the fire in the log for internal record-keeping purposes. (The school should not include this fire in its on - campus student housing facility fire statistics discussed in Chapter 13.) Chapter 12. The Fire Log: Recording Fires in On-campus Student Housing Facilities The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 12-3 Creating a Fire Log Required Fire Log Elements The law allows flexibility in how you design your fire log but you must include certain elements. For each fire, the log must include the date the fire was reported ; the nature of the fire ; the date and time of the fire; and the general location of the fire. You may include other data elements or columns in your log for internal record-keeping purposes, but this additional information is not required by the HEA . You also may include entries for fires other than those in on-campus student housing facilities, but you are not required to do so. If you record such fires, do not include statistics for them in your HEA-mandated annual fire safety report unless they are presented in a separate table or in a caveat. The Date the Fire Was Reported Use the date that the fire was initially reported. For example, if the fire was reported to a campus dean on a Friday and the dean reported it the following Monday to the office maintaining the log, Fridays date would be entered in the log. Enter the date the fire was reported regardless of how much time has passed since the fire occurred. The Nature of the Fire For this category you may simply use the causes listed under Cause of Fire in Chapter 13, or you may elaborate on them. Whatever you choose to do, enter a description that allows the reader to know what type of fire occurred. For example, instead of accidental or Arson, enter room fire caused by electrical malfunction or bulletin board intentionally set on fire. Use descriptions that any one reading the log can understand. Dont use codes, acronyms or abbreviations. Enter the date the fire was reported regardless of how much time has passed since the fire occurred . Chapter 12. The Fire Log: Recording Fires in On-campus Student Housing Facilities 12-4 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting The Date and Time of the Fire Enter the date the fire occurred and the time it started.

A business day is any day Monday through Friday, except for days when the institution is closed. If you have an electronic log, and you experience a software or computer problem, use a hard copy log as a temporary replacement. Make the fire log for the most recent 60- day period open to public inspection, upon request, during normal business hours. Make any portion of the log older than 60 days available within two business days of a request for public inspection. Anyone may have access to the log, whether or not they are associated with your institution. This includes the media. Chapter 12. The Fire Log: Recording Fires in On-campus Student Housing Facilities The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 12-5 Provide students and employees with a description of the log, noting its location and availability. Your institution may decide who or what department is responsible for maintaining the log and where it should be kept if its a hard copy log. Keep your archived fire logs for three years following the public ation of the last annual fire safety report to which it applies (in effect, seven years; see page 9 -11). Combining Your Fire Log With Your Daily Crime Log If your institution has a campus police or security department and is required to maintain a daily c rime log for Clery Act reporting (see Chapter 5), you may use that same log for your fire log. Label it in a manner that lets people know that it is both a crime log and a fire log. Make sure that it contains the required elements for both logs. You also may keep separate crime and fire logs. Note that if you have separate logs, they should differ as follows in terms of reporting fires: The fire log must record all reported fires, including Arson, in on-campus student housing facilities.

The crime log records all Arsons and att empted Arsons reported to a CSA that occur on campus (including student housing facilities), on public property, in noncampus buildings or property or within the patrol jurisdiction of that department. Reporting to the Campus Community The law states that an institution must make an annual report to the campus community on the fires recorded in the fire log. This requirement may be satisfied by the annual fire safety report. This report is described in detail in Chapter 14. This page intentionally left blank. The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 13-1 Fire Statistics: Classifying and Counting Fires in On- campus Student Housing Facilities CHAPTER 13 Fire statistics disclosure citation 34 CFR 668.49(c) In addition to the disclosure of your institutions fire safety- related policies and procedures, your annual fire safety report must contain statistics for reported fires in on -campus student housing facilities. This chapter discu sses in detail the various categories of required statistics. You must collect and include statistics for each on- campus student housing facility separately for the three most recent calendar years (i.e., Jan. 1 through Dec. 31) for which data are available. You may treat a group of attached buildings, such as a row of townhouses, as a single student housing facility if they share a name and have the same fire safety policies and systems. All other student housing facilities must be reported separately. If there were no reported fires in any of your on-campus student housing facilities in the three most recent calendar years, you may simply list the name and address of each facility in your annual fire safety report and state that there were no reported fires in the facilities for the reporting years. You must, however, enter 0 for each on-campus student housing facility in your Web-based survey. Required Fir e Statistics Identify each facility by name and street address, and for each facility include 1. the number of fires and the cause of each fire A fire, for the purposes of the HEA , is any instance of open flame or other burning in a place not intended to contain the burning or in an uncontrolled manner. (For more information about what is and isnt a fire, please see Chapter 11 .) Chapter 13. Fire Statistics: Classifying and Counting Fires in On -Campus Student Housing Facilities 13-2 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Cause of fire is defined as the factor or factors that give rise to a fire. The causal factor may be, but is not limited to, the result of an intentional or unintentional action, mechanical failure, or act of nature.

(A fire that is ignited, or that results from a deliberate action, in circumstances where the person knows there should not be a fire.) Example: Fire in a dorm restroom has been investigated by fire authorities and determined to be Arson. Perpetrator used matches to ignite paper towels. NOTE: Provide a description of all intentional fires. (For more information on intentional fires, see Arson in Chapter 3.) Undetermined Fire. (A fire in which the cause cannot be determined.) Example: Investigators cannot determine whether a couch was smoldering because someone accidentally dropped a lighted cigarette behind a cushion, or because someone intentionally set it on fire.

The term person may include students, employees, visitors, firefighters or any other individuals. Include indi viduals who are transported to a medical facility (even if they refuse treatment at the facility) ; individuals who are treated at a temporary medical facility that is set up at the fire site ; and individuals who are treated in an ambulance.

Chapter 13. Fire Statistics: Classifying and Counting Fires in On -Campus Student Housing Facilities 13-4 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting Examples of natural causes of fire- related death: Lung damage due to smoke inhalation Heart problems due to stress or exertion Examples of accidental causes of fire- related death: Getting struck by a falling object Getting burned by fallen wires Being killed by jumping out of a window Disclose the number of fire- related deaths for each fire. Although the regulations dont require your school to track every individual who has a fire-related injury for the purpose of documenting fire- related deaths, you must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the number of deaths that occur in a one- year period following a fire. A reasonable effort includes tracking individuals who are hospitalized a few miles from your school; tracking individuals who are still in contact with the school following the fire ; and documenting deaths that you learn of from other individuals or the media. 4. the value of property damage caused by a fire Value of property damage is defined as the estimated value of the loss of the structure and contents, in terms of the cost of replacement in like kind and quantity. This estimate should include contents damaged by fire, and related damages caused by smoke, water, and overhaul; however, it does not include indirect loss, such as business interruption. Disclose the value of property damage for each fire. Include the value of all property damage, even to property not owned or controlled by your institution. (If you want to make an additional disclosure to separate out institutional property damage and damage to the personal property of others, you may do so.) Your estimate for structural damage should be based on replacement value, not market value. Make sure to include the value of property destroyed during overhaul. Overhaul is the practice of searching a fire scene to detect Chapter 13.

If there is no property damagefor example a brief fire in a trash can that only destroyed discarded cigarette buttsindicate that the damage was in the 099 range. Fires in On-campus Student Housing Facilities That Are Physically Attached to Facilities Not Owned or Controlled by the Institution Perhaps y ou have a student housing facility located on the edge of your campus that is attached along one wall to a privately owned establishment, such as a restaurant. A fire that originates in the restaurant kitchen spreads to the student housing facility. Include this as a student housing fire. It is irrelevant whether the building had separate access for the student housing facility and the restaurant, or a single point of access. However, count injuries, damages, etc. only for the student housing facility, not for the restaurant. Chapter 13. Fire Statistics: Classifying and Counting Fires in On -Campus Student Housing Facilities 13-6 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting A Note About Arson As described in the Arson classification section in Chapter 3, the Clery Act requires your institution to disclose statistics for fires that are investigated and determined to meet the FBIs UCR definition of Arson. The A rson can occur anywhere within the institutions Clery Act geography: on campus (including in on-campus student housing facilities), in or on noncampus buildings or property, and public property. If your institution has a campus police or security department you also must record Arsons that are reported to that department in your daily crime log if the Arson occurs on your Clery Act geography or within the departments patrol jurisdiction. This means that an A rson that occurs in an on-campus student housing facility must be disclosed in your annual fire safety report, your fire log, your annual security report and your crime log (if you are required to keep a crime log). Remember, you must identify each on-campus student housing facility and enter the number of reported fires at each facility.

The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 14-1 The Annual Fire Safety Report: Publishing Policy Statements and Fire Statistics CHAPTER 14 Annual fire safety report citation 34 CFR 668.49(b) An institution that maintains any on -campus student housing facilities must publish an annual fire safety report by Oct. 1. This is a firm deadline; there is no grace period and there are no exemptions . The purpose of this report is to disclose fire safety policies and procedures related to your on- campus student housing and to disclose statistics for fires that occurred in those facilities. You may publish your annual fire safety report together with your Clery Act -required annual security report as long as the title of the document clearly states that it contains both reports. There is no prescribed order for the repor ts. If you choose to publish the reports together one year and separately the next year, you may. If you choose to publish the reports separately, you must include information in each report about how to directly access the other report.

If you choose to publish the reports together one year and separately the next year, you may. If you choose to publish the reports separately, you must include information in each report about how to directly access the other report. This means that you cant simply say that the other report is available; you must describe how an individual can obtain that report. The publication requirements for the fire safety report are the same as those for the annual security report and are found in Chapter 9. Remember that if you have a foreign campus with on- campus student housing facilities, an annual fire safety report must also be published for that campus. The law doesnt require your institution to adopt particular policies, procedures, programs or practices with respect to fire safety; the law prescribes how your institution collects, reports and disseminates the required information. The report must disclose your current policies, procedures, practices and rules. Descriptions of what your institution does regarding fire safety must be accurate and clear. For example, anyone reading your procedures for student housing evacuation in the case of a fire should be able to understand exactly what those procedures are, and the order in which they should be The publication requirements for the fire safety report are the same as those for the annual security report and are found in Chapter 9 . Chapter 14. The Annual Fire Safety Report: Publishing Policy Statements and Fire Statistics 14-2 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting followed. Your institution must adhere to the policies and procedures it discloses. If your institution does not have any fire safety experts on site, we suggest that you contact local experts, such as the fire marshal, fire chief, fire investigator or ot her local fire authorities for assistance in developing appropriate policies and procedures. Components of the Fire Safety Report At a minimum, the fire safety report must contain the components that are listed below. There is no prescribed order. All of the components pertain to on-campus student housing facilities, not the campus as a whole. 1. Description of each on -campus student housing facility fire safety system. What doe s this mean? Your statement should describe the fire safety system in each of your on-campus student housing faciliti es. It isnt enough to provide a general description of fire safety systems used in your facilities. A reader should be able to look for a specific facility and read a description for that facility. If you are not sure whether a specific mechanism or system is part of a fire safety system, ask yourself if the mechanism or system is related to the detection of a fire, warning resulting from a fire, or control of a fire. A fire safety system is defined as any mechanism or system related to the detection of a fire, the warning resulting from a fire, or the control of a fire. This may include s prinkler", "source": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf", "chunk_index": 148, "word_count": 500}
{"chunk_id": "handbook-for-campus-safety-and-security-reporting.pdf_chunk_149", "text": "the detection of a fire, warning resulting from a fire, or control of a fire. A fire safety system is defined as any mechanism or system related to the detection of a fire, the warning resulting from a fire, or the control of a fire. This may include s prinkler systems or other fire extinguishing systems, fire detection devices, stand -alone smoke alarms, devices that alert one to the presence of a fire, such as horns, bells, or strobe lights; smoke-control and reduction mechanisms; and fire doors and walls that reduce the spread of a fire. Chapter 14. The Annual Fire Safety Report: Publishing Policy Statements and Fire Statistics The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 14-3 For example, your institution might have egress lighting in the dormitories. Although egress lighting can be an element of a campus safety system, it is not part of a fire safety system because it is not used to detect, warn of or control a fire. You have f lexibility in how your institution addresses this requirement. The goal is to ensure that, at a minimum, students and families have enough information to understand what type of fire safety system is used in each on- campus student housing facility. For example, you may create a table that lists each student residential facility by name and has columns for checking whether a facility has any or all of the various systems and mechanisms identified, such as smoke alarms, fire doors, sprinkler systems, etc. If you use terms such as full or partial to describe a fire suppression system, explain what is meant by full or partial. The regulations dont require your institution to provide specific detailed information on your fire safety system or other systems, such as maintenance or inspection schedules. However, you may provide this or other pertinent information as you choose. Note that although you must disclose fire statistics for the previous three calendar years, your description of each on-campus student housing facility fire safety system must reflect the system that is currently in place.

The Annual Fire Safety Report: Publishing Policy Statements and Fire Statistics 14-4 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 2. Number of fire drills held during the previous calendar year. What does this mean? A fire drill is defined as a supervised practice of a mandatory evacuation of a building for a fire. Disclose the number of fire drills held during the previous calendar year for each on-campus student housing facility. If no fire drills were held for a facility during this time pe riod, you must indicate this. The requirement for a fire drill cannot be met by a false alarm that leads to the evacuation of a building, even if the evacuation is supervised. A drill involves planning, supervision and evaluation. 3. Policies or rules on portable electrical appliances, smoking and open flames in a student housing facility. What does this mean? Disclose all of your institutions policies or rules on portable electrical appliances, smoking and open flames in your on-campus student housing fac ilities. Its not adequate to state that you have such policies or rules; you must disclose the specifics and you must address all three categories: portable electrical appliances, smoking and open flames. If some rules apply to certain facilities only, state this. 4. Procedures for student housing evacuation in the case of a fire. What does this mean? Disclose your institutions procedures for evacuating a student housing facility in the case of a fire. If specific exits should be used or relocation procedures should be followed, state this. If the procedures differ by student housing facility, your statement must describe the specific procedures for each facility. Chapter 14. The Annual Fire Safety Report: Publishing Policy Statements and Fire Statistics The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting 14-5 5. Policies regarding fire safety education and training programs provided to the stu dents and employees. In these policies, the institution must describe the procedures that students and employees should follow in the case of a fire. What does this mean? Disclose all of your institutions policies related to fire safety education program s and fire safety training programs associated with on -campus student housing facilities. Include in-person and online programs, as applicable. Describe all procedures that students should follow in the case of a fire, as well as all procedures that employ ees should follow in the case of a fire. The policy statement must cover all employees involved in student housing and areas related to student housing, for example, residential life staff, student affairs staff, student personnel services staff, residence hall directors, residential education staff and summer housing staff.

If any of your student housing facilities has an attached parking garage or dining hall (as described in the bullets under the Definition of a Fire section in Chapter 11), include employees associated with those areas. You may include other employees as well. 6. For purposes of including a fire in the statistics in the annual fire safety report, a list of the titles of each person or organization to which students and employees should report that a fire occurred. What does this mean? This is a list of the titles of the people or organizations that should be told after the fact that a fire occurred. It is not a list of whom to notify that there is a fire emergency. That information should be included in the procedures that students and employees should follow in the case of a fire, as described in component no. 5 above. 7. Plans for future improvements in fire safety, if determined necessary by the institution. What does this mean? Your plan can be limited to Our institution is going to do the following or can include If we obtain funding wed like to do the following We suggest that you include information that tells the reader why the improvements are necessary. Do not simply state that the institution has plans for Chapter 14. The Annual Fire Safety Report: Publishing Policy Statements and Fire Statistics 14-6 The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting future improvements without indicating what those improvements will be. You may, but are not required to, include a time line. If you determine that future improvements in fire safety are not necessary, state this. 8. Fire statistics . Your annual fire safety report must include statistics for reported fires in on-campus student housing facilities. This requirement is discussed in detail in Chapter 13. In addition to including fire statistics in your annual fire safety report, your institution is required to submit the statistics from that report to the Department. The mechanism for doing this is the annual online Campus Safety and Security Survey that takes place in the fall. A registration packet with survey information, a password and a user ID are sent to the chief executive officer of your institution several weeks prior to the start of the data collection. Specific screen -by-screen instructions for completing the survey and submitting it to the Department are included in the users guide for the survey, which can be found at https:surveys.ope.ed.govcampussafety . You can get additional help with the survey by phone at 800-435-5985 or by e-mail at campussafetyhelpwestat.com .

In summary, the University of Missouri does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability, protected veteran status, or any othe r status protected by applicable state or federal law. The universitys nondiscrimination policy applies to all phases of its employment process, its admission and financial aid programs and to all other aspects of its educational programs and activities. Further, this policy includes prohibitions against sexual violence and sexual harassment (forms of sex discrimination) in accordance with Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106. MUs policy prohibits retaliation against any person who participates in protected activity, including making a report or complaint of discrimination. MU complies with applicable federal law in its education programs or activities, including provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the American s with Disabilities Act of 1990.

The University compiles this information in the Universitys Annual Security and Fire Safety Report. MUPD publishes this report with the MUPD Operations Commander (Captain) serving as MUs Clery Compliance Coordinator. MUPD submits the annual crime statistics published in this report to the Department of Education (ED). The statistical information gathered by the Department of Education is available to the public through the ED website. 8 This report contains three years of crime statistics related to incidents that occurred on the University Campus; in certain Off -Campus buildings or property owned or controlled by the University of Missouri; and on public property immediately adjacent to and accessible to the Campus. This report also includes institutional poli cies concerning campus security, such as policies regarding sexual assault, alcohol and other drugs. The University distributes a notice of t he availability of this Annual Fire Safety and Security Report by October 1 of each year to every member of the Univ ersity community through email. The notice includes a brief summary of the contents of the Annual Security Report, the address for MUPD and where the Annual Security Reports can be found on -line. Anyone, including prospective students and employees, may obtain a paper co py of this report by contacting Kevin Rodgers at 573 -882-2187 or by visiting mupolice.com REPORTING CRIMES AND OTHER EMERGENCIES Reporting to MU Police MU students, faculty, staff and visitors are encouraged to accurately and promptly report all cri mes, to the Universit y of Missouri Police Department or appropriate local law enforcement when the victim of a crime elects to, or is unable to, make such a report. To report a crime or an emergency on the MU Campus, call MUPD at 573 -882-7201 , 311 or 911. Crimes should be reported to MUPD and the primary CSAs identified below, for purposes of assessing the crime for distributing a potential timely warning crime notification or emergency alert and for disclosure in the annual crime statistics. 9 Communications Officers are available at MUPD 24 hours a day to answer your call.

In response to a call, MUPD Communications will generally dispatch an officer to the requested location of the caller to file an incident report. In certain circumstances , the caller may be requested to respond to MUPD to meet an officer or the officer may be able to take the required information over the phone. A police officer will gather the proper information, begin an investigation, and complete a written report. If appropriate , an investigator may be contacted to assist. If assistance is required from the Columbia Police, Boone County Sheriffs Department or Columbia Fire Department, MUPD will contact the appropriate unit. If it is determined the incident occurred outside of the jurisdiction of MUPD, the caller will be assisted in contacting the appropriate local law enforcement agency. If a sexual assault should occur, staff on the scene, including MUPD, will offer the victim a wide variety of services. Incident repo rts may be forwarded to the Office of Student Accountability Support or Office of Institutional Equity for review. Reporting to Other Campus Security Authorities While the University strongly encourages community members to immediately report all crimes and other emergencies directly to the MU Police at (573) 882 -7201 or 911, MUPD also recognizes that some may prefer to report to other individuals or University offices. The Clery Act recognizes certain University officials and offices a s Campus Security Authorities (CSAs). The Act defines these individuals as an a) University Police b) Non-police personnel responsible for on -campus security. c) Official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including but not limited to, student housing, student discipline and campus judicial proceedings. An official is defined as any person who has the authority and the duty to take action or respond to particular issues on behalf of the institution. d) Any individual or organization specified in a statement of the Universitys security policies as a place to report criminal offenses. Outside of the police department, these individuals generally meet the criteria for being a campus security authority. Dean of Students Director of Athletics and All Athletic Coaches Faculty Advisor to a Student Organization Residence Hall Coordinator, Assistant or Advisor 10 Coordinator of Greek Affairs An Ombudsperson (including student ombudspersons) Director of Campus Health or Counseling Center Victim Advocates Members of a Sexual Assault Response Team The function of a campus security authority is to report to MUPD or any of the below listed offices any crime report information they receive.

While the University has identified several individual CSAs in the above category , we officially designate the following offices as places where University community members should report crimes: Official Campus Address Phone Number University of Missouri Police Department 901 Virginia Ave. (573) 882 -7201 Office of Institutional Equity 320 Jesse Hall and 145 Heinkel Building 573-882-3880 Human Resources 1105 Carrie Francke Dr .

The log identifies the nature, general location, date and time reported, date and time occurred and disposition. The Daily Crime Log for the most current 60 days is available for viewing in the lobby of MUPD at 901 Virginia Avenue, Columbia MO, 65211. Any portion of the Daily Crime Log that is older than 60 days will be made available within two business days of a public request. Emergency Phones The University has installed emergency phones throughout the University of Missouri campus. Phones are located in public areas of buildings including parking garages, elevators, residence hall complexes, administration buildings, and numerous outdoor locations. Emergency phones provide direct voice communications to the University Police Communications Center. Limited Voluntary Confidential Reporting Procedures MUPD encourages anyone who is the victim or witness to any crime to promptly report the incident to the police. MU will protect the confidentiality of victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking to the fullest extent of the law. Because police reports are public records under the Missouri Sunshine Law , MUPD may not be able to hold reports of crime in confidence. However, the Missouri Sunshine Law does provide some exceptions . The MO Sunshine Law states, if any portion of a record or document of a law enforcement officer or agency, other than an arrest report, which would otherwise be open, contains information that is reasonably likely to pose a clear and present danger to the safety of any victim , witness, undercover officer, or other person; or jeopardize a criminal investigation, including records which would disclose the identity of a source wishing to remain confidential or a suspect not in custody; or which would disclose techniques, procedures or guideline for law enforcement investigation or prosecutions, that portion", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 4, "word_count": 500}
{"chunk_id": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf_chunk_5", "text": "any victim , witness, undercover officer, or other person; or jeopardize a criminal investigation, including records which would disclose the identity of a source wishing to remain confidential or a suspect not in custody; or which would disclose techniques, procedures or guideline for law enforcement investigation or prosecutions, that portion of the record shall be closed and shall be redacted from any record made available. Pursuant to Revised Missouri Statutes 610.100, a victim of RSMO Chapter 566 (Sex Offenses) may request that his or her identity be kept confidential until a charge relating to such incident is filed. With your permission, MUPD can file a report on the det ails of a sexual assault without revealing your identity. The purpose of a confidential report is to comply with your wish to keep the matter confidential, while taking steps to ensure the future safety of yourself and others. With such information, the University can keep an accurate record of the number of incidents involving students, employees and visitors; determine where there is a pattern of crime with regard to a particular location, method, or assailant; and alert the campus community to potentia l danger. Reports 12 filed in this manner are counted and disclosed in the annual crime statistics for the institution. Confidential r eports for purposes of inclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics can generally be made through the Office of Institutional Equity. Anonymous reports are not the same as confidential reporting. If you are interested in reporting a crime anonymously, you can utilize the University Polices Silent Witness program . We do not attempt to trace the origin of the person who submits this form, unless such is deemed necessary for public safety. Persons may also report crimes through Crime Stoppers at (573) 875 -TIPS (8477). Anyone may call the University Police at 573 -882-7201 to report concerning information. Pastoral and Professional Counselors According the Clery Act, pastoral and professional counselors who are appropriately credentialed and hired by the University of Missouri to serve in a counseling role are not considered Campus Security Authorities when they are acting in the counseling rol e. As a matter of policy, the University encourages pastoral and professional counselors to notify those whom they are counseling of the limited voluntary confidential reporting procedures available to them for sexual assault reports. Pastoral Counselor : An employee of an institution, who is associated with a religious order or denomination, recognized by that religious order or denomination as someone who provides confidential counseling and who is functioning within the scope of that recognition as a p astoral counselor. Professional Counselor : An employee of an institution whose official responsibilities include providing psychological counseling to members of the institutions community, and who is functioning within the scope of his or her license or certification. 13 About the University of Missouri Police Department Role and Authority The University of Missouri Police Department (MUPD) is a professionally accredited police department .

This includes i ntraoperative radio capability, training programs, special events coordination, investigation of serious incidents and the shared 911 Center. The Columbia Police Department and Boone County Sheriffs Department have arrest authority on -campus as well, alt hough they normally do not exercise this power within University controlled buildings and MU On -Campus Student Housing without notifying or seeking the assistance of the University of Missouri Police Department. Additionally, MUPD often calls on the Columbia City Police, Boone County Sheriffs Department and the Missouri State Highway Patrol for assistance with large -scale events on -campus. During these events Officers, Deputies and State Troopers from all agencies have full arrest powers. 16 The University of Missouri Police Department participates in Mutual Aid Agreements that authorizes police officers and supervisors of the participating agencies to request mutual aid for incidents based upon a reasonable belief that such aid will enhance t he publics andor officer safety and efficiency. Agencies participating in these Agreements include the Columbia Police Department, Boone County Sheriffs Department , and Veterans Administration Police. The mutual aid agreement does not apply to the inves tigation of most criminal cases, as MUPD provides the full range of police services. A MUPD officer is assigned to the Boone County Cyber Crimes Task Force. This officer serves as a forensic analyst investigating cyber -crimes and making arrests in those cases, on or off - campus. A MUPD Officer serves on the Mid -Missouri Bomb S quad which handles incidents both on or off -campus. Another MUPD Supervisor serves on the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force. MUPD has one K9 ( Azdra ) certified in explosive detection. When requested, Azdra and h er handler will assist local law enforcement with investigating suspicious packages. The Missouri State Statutes of 172.350 172.355 allows the department to provide assistance to, or request assistance from, the three additional University of Missouri affiliated police departments in Rolla MO, Kansas City MO and St. Louis MO. When assistance has be en formally requested, the assisting officers have arrest authority. Crimes Involvi ng Student Organizations at Non-Campus Locations The University of Missouri has officially recognized student organizations that have non - campus housing facilities. These non -campus housing facilities , primarily fraternities and sororities fall under the jurisdiction o f the University of Missouri Police Department . MUPD is the primary agency responsible for responding to emergency and non- emergency calls for service at these locations. Recognized student organizations that may have functions at off campus locations that do not meet the Clery Act geography definition will fall under the jurisdiction of CPD.

CPD may out of courtesy notify MU of any incidents occurring off campus. The University of Missouri expects all recognized student organizations to abide by federal, state, and local laws, and University regulations. Except for the non -campus housing facilities mentioned above, the University will generally be limited to conduct which occurs on the University of Missouri premises or at University -sponsored or University -supervised functions. However, the University may take appropriate action, including, but not limited to the imposition of sanction s under Sections 200.020 and 200.025 of the Collected Rules and Regulations as well as the Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct in EducationEmployment Policy 600.020 . 17 TIMELY WARNINGS CRIME NOTIFICATIONS As an institution covered by the Clery Act, the Uni versity must send timely warnings - crime notifications on Clery Act crimes occurring in its Clery geography that are reported to MUPD, Campus Security Authorities or local police agencies, and considered by the University t o represent a serious or continuing threat to students and employees. The Timely Warning Crime Notification requirement applies to all Clery Act crimes and all require a case -by-case assessment as to whether the report presents a serious or continuing threat to the campus community. Crime Notifications are typically issued for the following crime classifications: murdernon -negligent manslaughter, major incidents of arson, robbery, a string of burglaries or motor vehicle thefts that occur in reasonably close proximity to one another, and sex offenses. Incidents of aggravated assault and sex offenses are considered on a case -by-case basis, depending on the facts of the case and the information known to law enforcement. For example, if an assault occurs between two students who have a disagreement, there may be no on -going threat to other University community members and a Crime Notification would not be distributed. In cases involving sexual assault, they are often reported days, weeks, months or even years after the incident occurred , thus there is no ability to distribute a timely warning notice crime notification to the community. Sex offenses will be considered on a case -by- case basis depending on when and where the incident occurred, when it was reported, and the amount of in formation known by law enforcement. MU Police Supervisors review reports on a daily basis for assessment of an on -going threat to the community. The MUPD Chief of Police as well as the Assistant Vice Chancellor for the Office of Institutional Equity andor their desig nee are responsible for making the decision to issue a Crime Notification. A member of the MU Media Relations will draft and dis seminate the Crime Notification. Crime Notifications are generally issued via blast email.

All Crime Notifications will be provided to students and employees in a manner that is timely, that wi thholds the names of victims as confidential, and that will aid in the prevention of similar occurrences. Content of a Crime Notification The following information is typically included in a crime notification if available: i. A statement of the incident, including the nature and severity of the threat and the persons or locations that might be affected. ii. Any connection to a previous incident(s). 18 iii. Physical description andor composite drawing of the suspect. iv. Date and time warning was released. v. Appropriate safety tips. When issuing a crime notification , some specific information may be withheld if there is a risk of compromising law enforcement efforts to investigate andor solve the crime. EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND EVACUATION PROCEDURES Emergency Management at MU The University of Missouri Police Department is responsible for the MU Emergency Management Plan (EMP). The EMP is an all -hazards disaster response and emergency management plan that complies with FEMA guidelines for Higher Education . The Emergency Management Plan provides the framework to structure the response and resources of MU academic and administrative community to any emergency affecting the Unive rsity of Missouri. The University of Missouri Police Department activates the EMP when an emergency affecting MU reaches proportions that cannot be handled by established measures. This emergency may be sudden and un foreseen, or there may be varying periods of warning. The University of Missouri intends the EMP to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate contingencies of all types, magnitudes, and durations. Our priorities are: Life safety, infrastructure integrity, and environmental protection during an emergency . Coordination with university departments to write, maintain, test, and exercise the EMP . Cooperation, Integration, and Mutual Aid with local, state and federal planning, response, and public safety agencies and their CEMPs. A summary of the Universitys emergency response procedures is located at MU Alert. Included at this web site is detailed information regarding the Universitys emergency notification policy, including how to enroll in the emergency notification system to ensure you receive emergency notices on University email and personal cell phones . Emergency Notification - Drills, Exercises and Training The University of Missouri is committed to ensuring the campus community receives timely, accurate, and useful information in the event of a significant emergency or dangerous situation on campus or in the local area that poses an immediate threat to the health and safety of campus community members.

MU tests the emergency notification 19 system components once every term as well as during the states March Tornado Drill. The University uses a tiered emergency notification system that uses Rave Mobile Alert , Alertus Beacons and desktop notification. The MU Alert text messaging system is an emergency notification system available to s tudents and staff at MU that opt ed in to the emergency alert system . Alerts sent are simulcast to the University community via our MU Alert , the University Facebook page, MUPD Twitter, e -mail accounts and cell phone text. The University conducts at least one test of its emergency response and evacuation procedures . The test may be announced or unannounced. These exercises may include tabletop drills, emergency operations center exercises, or full -scale emergency response exercises. MUPD and MU Emergency Management develop an exercise scenario , schedules and coordinates the events with local, state, and federal response agencies as well as stakeho lders. In conjunction with at least one emergency management test each year, the University will notify the community of the information included in the Universitys publicly available information regarding emergency response and evacuation procedures. The University community will be notified of th ese procedures through the mass email system. All community members with a valid MU email will be designated to receive th is notification. The University will also notify local ne ws media of the emergency procedures . The University conducts after -action reviews of all emergency management test documenting a description of the exercise, the date, the time, and whether it was announced or unannounced. In addition to the above procedures Boone County conducts monthly tests of the tornado warning sirens. Several of these sirens are located on and adjacent to MU and can be heard in exterior areas of the campus as well as some interior locations. During these monthly siren tests, MU does not activate t heir emergency notification system. Procedures Used to Notify the Campus Community Upon confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students and employees MU will, with out delay, determine the content of the notification and immediately initiate the no tification system, unless issuing a notification will, in the professional judgment of responsible authorities, compromise efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency. The University has various systems in place for comm unicating information quickly. Some or all of these methods of communication may be activated in the event of emergency notification to all or a segment of the campus community. These methods of communication include the use of electronic and cellular communication through the mass text notification system MU Alert, the Universitys e -mail system, Alertus beacons , desktop notification within a building and publ ic", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 10, "word_count": 500}

These methods of communication include the use of electronic and cellular communication through the mass text notification system MU Alert, the Universitys e -mail system, Alertus beacons , desktop notification within a building and publ ic address system on police vehicles . If any 20 of these systems fail or the University deems it appropriate, in person communication may be used to communicate the emergency. If there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on campus, an institution must follow its emergency procedures. An institution that follows its emergency notification procedures is not required to issue a timely warning based on the same circumstances; however, the institution must provide adequate follow - up information to the community as needed. The University will issue periodic updates throughout the situation utilizing the same methods above. When the emergency situation is over, the University will issue an All Clear message. If the situation warrants, the University will establish a telephone call -in center to communicate with the University community during an emergency situation. Messages may direct individuals to evacuate, shelter in place, stay away from an area or contain other information pertinent to the situation. In the event of a weather emergency such as a tornado, The National Weather Service will provide guidance to the Boone County Emergency Management Office. Tornado warning sirens will be activated throughout the City of Columbia, including the University of Missouri Campus. When a tornado warning is issued within Boone County, the University of Missouri emergency notification system automatically activates sending communication throughout the Rave Mobile Alert , Alertus Beacons and desktop notification . The University of Missouri emergency notification system is maintained by Police Communications along with certain members of the MU Media Relations. All MU Police Communications Officers are trained in the initiation process for an emergency notification. MU Police leadership: Chief, Captain, Lieutenants, Sergeants and Officers in Charge are responsible for initiating the notification system. Confirming the Existence of a Significant Emergency or Dangerous Situation and Initiating the Emergency Notification System Generally, The University of Missouri Police Department will be responsible for confirming the existence of a significant emergency or dangerous situation. In certain circumstances, o ther first responders such as Fire Personnel, En vironmental Health Safety, Public Health Officia ls or Campus FacilitiesMaintenance Personnel will assist MUPD with confirming a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or staff exists on campus. If a significant emergency or dangerous situation is confirmed, a MUPD Supervisor will notify MUPD Communications to immediately activate the emergency notification system. 21 If, in the professional judgment of first responders, issuing a notification potentially compromises efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency, the University may elect to delay issuing an emergency notificat ion.

As soon as the condition that may compromise efforts is no longer present, the University will issue the emergency notification to the campus community. The most expedient way to report an emergency occurring on the University of Missouri Campus is to call 911. Individuals may also call the MU Police Department directly at 573-882-7201. Determining the Appropriate Segment or Segments of the Campus Community to Receive an Emergency Notification The MU Police andor local first responders on the scene of a critical incident or dangerous situation will assist those preparing the emergency notification with determining what segment or segments of the University community should re ceive the notification. If the emergency affects a significant portion of the entire campus, University officials will distribute the notification to the entire campus community. However, i f appropriate to a specific incident , the MU Alertus system does have the capability to activate Alertus beacons and desktop notifications to campus community members in the immediate area of the dangerous situation (i.e. a specific building or adjacent buildings.) In this instance, University officials will continue to monitor the situation an d may send subsequent notifications to a wider group of community members. Determining the Contents of the Emergency Notification The University of Missouri Police leadership consists of a Chief, Major, Captain, Lieutenants, Sergeants, and Officers in Charge. The responsibility to initiate the emergency notification system generally rests with the lieutenant, sergeant or Officer in Charge who is on duty at the time of the eme rgency. They will determine the contents of the notification based on each situation. MUPD leadership along with the MU Media Relations have developed a wide range of template messag es addressing a variety of emergency situations. The supervisor authorizing the alert will select the template message most appropriate to the ongoing situation . In situations where there are no pre - determined template messages in the system, the supervisor authorizing the alert will develop the most succinct message to convey the appropriate information to the community. The goal is to ensure individuals are aware of the situation and that they know the steps to take to safeguard their personal and communi ty safety. Procedures for Disseminating Emergency Information to the Greater Community Parents, community members and others who do not have an account with the university can sign up for alerts in two ways. To receive emergency text messages, text GetMUalerts to number 67283. A message should be received confirming your number has been added to the system.

Enrolling in the University s Emergency Notification System The University encourage members of the campus comm unity to enroll in the MU Alert System. University community members should regularly update their information at the same site. Emergency Evacuation Procedures The emergency evacuation procedures are tested at least twice each year. Students and employees learn the locations of the emergency exits in the buildings and are provided guidance about the direction they should travel when exiting each facility for a short-term building evacuation. MUPD does not tell building occupants in advance about the designated locations for long -term evacuations because those decisions are affected by time of day, location of the building being evacuated, the availability of the various designated emergency gathering locations on campus, and other factors such as the location and nature of the threat. In both cases, MUPD staff on the scene will communicate information to students regarding the developing situation or any evacuation status changes. The purpose of evacuation drills is to prepare building occupants for an organized evacuation in case of a fire or other emergency. At MU evacuation drills are used as a way to educate and train occupants on fire safety issues specific to their building. During the drill, occupants practice drill procedures and familiarize themselves with the location of exits and the sound of the fire alarm. General Evacuation Procedures At the sound of a fire alarm or if you are instructed to evacuate, leave your work area immediately and proceed to the nearest exit, and leave the building. If you are the first to recognize a fire situation, activate the alarm, evacuate to a safe location using the nearest exit, and dial 911. 1. Remain Calm 2. Do NOT use Elevators, Use the Stairs. 23 3. Assist the physically impaired. If heshe unable to exit without using an elevator, secure a safe location near a stairwell, and immediately inform MUPD or the Columbia Police Department of the individual's location. 4. Proceed to a clear area at least 150 feet from the building. Keep all walkways clear for emergency vehicles. 5. Make sure all personnel are out of the building. 6. Do not re -enter the building.

Make sure all personnel are out of the building. 6. Do not re -enter the building. Shelter -in-Place Procedures What it Means to Shelter -in-Place If an incident occurs and the buildings or areas around you become unstable, or if the air outdoors becomes dangerous due to toxic or irritating substances, it is usually safer to stay indoors, because leaving the area may expose you to that danger. Thus, t o shelter -in-place means to make a shelter of the building that you are in, and with a few adjustments this location can be made even safer and more comfortable until it is safe to go outside. Basic Shelter -in-Place Guidance If an incident occurs and the building you are in is not damaged, stay inside an interior room until you are told it is safe to come out. If your building is damaged, take your personal belonging (purse, wallet, access card, etc.) and follow the evacuation procedures for your building (close your door, proceed to the nearest exit, and use the stairs instead of the elevators). Once you have evacuated, seek shelter at the nearest University building quickly. If police or fire department personnel are on the s cene, follow their directions. How You Will Know to Shelter -in-Place A shelter -in-place notification may come from several sources, MUPD, Housing Staff members, other University employees, Local PD, or other authorities utilizing the University s emergency communications tools. How to Shelter in-Place No matter where you are, the basic steps of shelter -in-place will generally remain the same. Should the need ever arise, follow these steps, unless instructed otherwise by local emergency personnel: 1. If you are inside, stay where you are. Collect any emergency shelter -in- place supplies and a telephone to be used in case of emergency. If you are outdoors, proceed into the closest building quickly or follow instructions from emergency personnel on the sc ene. 2. Locate a room to shelter inside. It should be: An interior room; Above ground level; and 24 Without windows or with the least number of windows. If there is a large group of people inside a particular building, several rooms maybe necessary. 3. Shut and lock all windows (tighter seal) and close exterior doors. 4. Turn off air conditioners, heaters, and fans. 5. Close vents to ventilation systems as you are able. (University staff will turn off the ventilation as quickly as possible.) 6. Make a list of the people with you and ask someone (hall staff, faculty, or other staff) to call the list in to MUPD so they know where you are sheltering. If only students are present, one of the students should call in the list. 7. Turn on a radio or TV and listen for further instructions. 8. Make yourself comfortable.

SECURITY OF and ACCESS TO UNIVERSITY FACILITIES Academic and Administrative Buildings The University of Missouri Campus is part of the City of Columbia and, as such, is open to the public. The academic and administrative buildings are open to the public, at a minimum, during normal business hours. Most facilities have individual hours, and the hours may vary at different times of the year. Access to some of these buildings is also contro lled by card access after normal business hours, and all of these buildings have varied levels of access. A cademic and administrative buildings do not ha ve a MUPD Officer assigned to them. However, MUPD officers patrol the academic and administrative buildings on a regular basis. For information about the access protocol for a specific 25 building, see the building manager, a department head, or contact MUPD at 573 -882- 7201. Housing All University residence halls have a 24 -hour security program that includes many security measures. Exterior residence hall doors, except those that lead past desks, are locked at all times. Students may enter locked doors of their hall using their ID card. The exterior doors that lead past desks lock electronically when the desk closes (typically 11:00 PM) and the hall is then closed to the public. Security devices are installed on ground floor windows and room doors have dead bolt locks and door viewers. Residents can protect themselves and their property by responsible decisions. Unescorted persons should not be given access to residence halls after hours; residents can access their own halls after hours by swiping their student id card through the car d reader. Doors should not be propped open at any time. The names and telephone numbers and locations of on -call student staff are posted inside and on main exterior entrances of the residence halls; each resident should locate this information in advance of an emergency. Wallet cards with on -call contact information are available from the residence hall information desk. Keeping every room door locked at all times will deter crime . Theft in a residence hall is often a result of an unsecured room or unattended belongings. Every security measure taken by the residence hall staff depends on the responsible actions of each resident for its effectiveness. Residence Halls do not have a MUPD Officer assigned to them. MUPD officers regularly patrol the exterior and lobby area of Residence Halls. Residential Life Staff enforce security measures in the halls and work with residents to achieve a community respectful of individual a nd group rights . Residential Life Staff, along with MUPD Officers also conduct periodic educational programs on prevention of various crimes, including sexual assault and acquaintance rape.

A protection order can send a strong message to the abuse r letting them know that abusive behavior is not acceptable and it is illegal. You can file an order of protection 24 hours a day against the person who is abusing you.

Confidentiality exists in the context of laws that protect certain relationships, including with medical and clinical care providers (and those who provide administrative services related to the provision of medical and clinical care), mental health provid ers, counselors, and ordained clergy, all of who may engage in confidential communications under Missouri Law. Several offices and employees within MU fall under the guidelines of a confidential employee. When information is shared with a confidential employee or community professional with the same legal protections, the confidential employee (andor such community professional) cannot reveal the information to a third party except when an applicable law or a court order requires or permits disclosure of such information. For example, information may be disclosed when (i) the individual gives written consent for its disclosure, (ii) there is a concern that the individual will likely cause serious physical harm to self or others; (iii) the information c oncerns conduct involving suspected abuse or neglect of a minor. An Employees responsibility to report incidents of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, stalking on the basis of sex, datingintimate partner violence or sexual exploitation falls under MU Policy 600.020. Under this policy every MU Em ployee is desig nated as a Mandated Reporter. Pursuant to the Clery Act, MU includes statistics about certain offenses in its annual security report and provides those statistics to the United States Department of Education in a manner that does not include any personally identifying information about individual s in an incident. The Clery Act also requires MU to issue timely warnings to the MU Community about certain crimes that have been reported and may continue to pose a serious or continuing threat to Student and Employees. Consistent with the Cl ery Act, MU withholds the names and other personally identifying information of Complainants when issuing timely warnings or emergency notification to the MU Community, and in the maintenance of the daily crime log. MU will also maintain as confidential a ny accommodation or protective measures provided to the victim, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of the institution to provide the accommodations or protective measures. 46 PROGRAMS T O PREVENT SEXUAL ASSAULT, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, DATING VIOLENCE, AND STALKING The University of Missouri encourages the campus community to be responsible for their own security and the security of others.

Programs to prevent dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking include both primary prevention and awareness programs directed at incoming students and new employees and ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns directed at students and employees. All incoming students and new employees are provided with programming and strategies intended to prevent rape, acquaintance rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking before it occurs through the changing of so cial norms and other approaches. These programs include (1) statements that MU prohibits such acts; (2) the jurisdictional definitions of related crimes; (3) the jurisdictional definition of consent; (4) options for bystander intervention that may be carried out by an indi vidual to prevent harm or intervene when there is risk of prohibited conduct against another person; (5) information about risk reduction to recognize warning signs of abusive behavior; (6) information about the procedures that MU will follow after an incident of prohibited conduct has occurred ; the institutions definition of consent and the purposes for which that definition is used. We offer ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns throughout the year that also includes this content. The Office of Institutional Equity and the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Center are primarily responsible for sexual assault education and awareness in collaboration with many offices at the University. Together, these offices offer a variety of programming focusing on sexual and gend er violence. 47 Consent Defined by Missouri Revised Statutes Section 556.061 (14). Consent: consent or lack of consent may be expressed or implied. Assent does not constitute consent if: (a) It is given by a person who lacks the mental capacity to authorize the conduct charged to constitute the offense and such mental incapacity is manifest or known to the actor; or (b) It is given by a person who by reason of youth, mental disease or defect, intoxication, a drug -induced state, or any other reason is manifestly unable or known by the actor to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute the offense; or (c) It is induced by force, duress or deception. Consent Defined by the University of Missouri Consent to sexual activity is knowing and voluntary.

Consent to sexual activity requires of all involved persons a conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Each person engaged in the sexual activity must have met the legal age of consent. It is the responsibility of each person to ensure they have the consent of all others engaged in the sexual activity. Consent must be obtained at the time of the specific activity and can be withdrawn at any time. Consent, lack of consent or withdraw al of consent may be communicated by words or non -verbal acts. Someone who is incapacitated cannot consent. Silence or absence of resistance does not establish consent. The existence of a dating relationship or past sexual relations between the Parties involved should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent. Further, consent to one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another. Coercion and force, or threat of either, invalidates consent. This definition of consent is used during an alleged violation and investigation of sexual assault, sex discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct per MU Policy 600.020 . For Clery Act reporting purposes, all sexual assaults that are reported to a CSA are included in the statistics submitted to the Department of Education regardless of the issue of consent. Primary Prevention Programs These p rogramming initiatives and strategies are informed by research or assessed for value effectiveness or outcome that are intended to stop sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking before they occur through the promotion of positive and healthy behaviors that foster healthy, mutually respectful relationships and 48 sexuality, encourage safe bystander intervention and seek to change behavior in social norms in healthy and safe directions. Mizzou Bystander Intervention Initiative The University of Missouri is committed to creating a healthy and safe environment for all students. We are utilizing a new in -person training program, Mizzou Bystander Intervention Initiative, to promote community connectedness and civic engagement with the overall goal of empowering students to get involved in situations where they can prevent, reduce, or respond to harm. Mizzou Bystander Intervention Initiative works to address multiple, interconnected issues including alcohol and other drug use, issues of bias and discrimination, interpersonal violence, and mental well -being. Risk Reduction With no intent to victim blame and recognizing that only abusers are responsible for their abuse, the following are some strategies to reduce ones risk of sexual assault or harassment (taken from Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network, www.rainn.org) Be aware of your surroundings. Knowing where you are and who is around you may help you to find a way to get out of a bad situation. Try to avoid isolated areas. It is more difficult to get help if no one is around.

It is more difficult to get help if no one is around. Walk with purpose. Even if you dont know where you are going, act like you do. Trust your instincts. If a situation or location feels unsafe or uncomfortable, it probably isnt the best place to be. Try not to load yourself down with packages or bags as this can make you appear more vulnerable. Make sure your cell phone is with you and charged and that you have cab money. Don't allow yourself to be isolated with someone you dont trust or someone you dont know. Avoid putting music headphones in both ears so that you can be more aware of your surroundings, especially if you are walking alone. When you go to a social gathering, go with a group of friends. Arrive together, check in with each other throughout the evening, and leave together. Knowing where you are and who is around you may help you to find a way out of a bad situation. Trust your instincts. If you feel unsafe in any situation, go with your gut. If you see something suspicious, contact law enforcement immediately (local authorities can be reached by calling 911 in most areas of the U.S.). 49 Don't leave your drink unattended while talking, dancing, using the restroom, or making a phone call. If youve left your drink alone, just get a new one. Don't accept drinks from people you don't know or trust. If you choose to accept a drink, go with the person to the bar to order it, watch it being poured, and carry it yourself. At parties, dont drink from punch bowls or other large, common open containers. Watch out for your friends, and vice versa. If a friend seems out of it, is way too intoxicated for the amount of alcohol theyve had, or is acting out of character, get him or her to a safe place immediately. If you suspect you or a friend has been drugged, contact law enforcement immediately (local authorities can be reached by calling 911 in most areas of the U.S.). Be explicit with doctors so they can give you the correct tests (you will need a urine test and possibly others). If you need to get out of an uncomfortable or scary situation here are some things that you can try: Remember that being in this situation is not your fault. You did not do anything wrong, it is the person who is making you uncomfortable that is to blame. Be true to yourself. Don't feel obligated to do anything you don't want to do. I don't want to is always a good enough reason. Do what feels right to you and what you are comfortable with. Have a code word with your friends or family so that if you dont feel comfortable you can call them and communicate your discomfort", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 35, "word_count": 500}

Your friends or family can then come to get you or make up an excuse for you to leave. Lie. If you dont want to hurt the persons feelings it is better to lie and make up a reason to leave than to stay and be uncomfortable, scared, or worse. Some excuses you could use are needing to take care of a friend or family member, not feeling well, having somewhere else that you need to be, etc. Try to think of an escape route . How would you try to get out of the room? Where are the doors? Windows? Are there people around who might be able to help you? Is there an emergency phone nearby? If you andor the other person have been drinking, you can say that you would rather wait until you both have your full judgment before doing anything you may regret later. 50 MUs primary prevention and awareness program in 202 4 for all incoming students is: U Got This! and U Got This 2!

The Notice of Allegations will be made in writing to the Parties by email to the Partys University -issued email account, with a read -receipt or reply email requested. If a read - receipt or reply email is not returned within three (3) business days or the P arty does not have a University -issued email account, the Notice of Allegations shall be sent via U.S. 65 Mail postage pre -paid to the last known address of the Party. Notice also may be provided in person to either Party. Notice is presumptively deemed delivered, when: 1) provided in person, 2) emailed to the individual, or 3) when mailed. 8. Supportive Measures, Emergency Removal, Interim Suspension of Student Organization, and Administrative Leave 1. Supportive Measures. Supportive measures are non -disciplinary, non -punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the Complainant or the Respondent before or after the filing of a Formal Complaint or where no For mal Complaint has been filed. These measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the Universitys education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other Party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all Parties or the Universitys education environment, or deter sexual harassment. The University will maintain as confidential any Supportive Measures provided to the Complainant or Respondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentialit y would not impair the ability of the University to provide the Supportive Measures. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for the effective implementation of Supportive Measures. Supportive Measures may include: 1. Referral and facilitating contact for the Complainant or Respondent for counseling or other support services. 2. Mutual restrictions on contact between the Parties. 3. Providing campus escort services to the Parties. 4. Increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus. 5. Adjusting the extracurricular activities, work schedules, work assignments, supervisory responsibilities, or work arrangements of the Complainant andor the Respondent, as appropriate. 6. If either Party is a student: (1) Referral of that Party to academic support services and any other services that may be beneficial to the Party. (2) Adjusting the courses, assignments, andor exam schedules of the Party. (3) Altering the on -campus housing assignments, dining arrangements, or other campus services for the Party. 7. Providing limited transportation accommodations for the Parties. 8.

Informing the Parties of the right to notify law enforcement authorities of the alleged incident and offering to help facilitate such a report. 2. Emergency Removal. The Title IX Coordinator may implement a removal of a Respondent from the Universitys education program or activity on an emergency basis, if the Title IX Coordinator, after conducting an individualized safety and risk analysis, determines that an immedi ate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or 66 other individual arising from the allegations of sexual harassment, justifies removal. 1. In all cases in which an Emergency Removal is imposed, the Respondent will immediately be given notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision of the Title IX Coordinator either prior to such Removal being imposed, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible but no later than five (5) business days following the Removal. Any challenge by Respondent shall be made in writing and directed to the Title IX Coordinator and must show cause why the Removal should not be implemented. The Title IX Coordinator w ill forward the challenge to the Emergency Removal Appeal IndividualCommittee, which will make a final decision on Removal within three (3) business days. 2. Violation of an Emergency Removal under this policy may be grounds for discipline under applicable University conduct policy. 3. Interim Suspension of Student Organization. The Title IX Coordinator may suspend, on an interim basis, a Respondent Student Organizations operations, University recognition, access to and use of the University campusfacilitiesevents andor all other University activities or privileges for which the Respondent Student Organization might otherwise be eligible, pending the completion of the Title IX Process when the Title IX Coordinator finds and believes from available information that the presence of the student organization on campus would seriously disrupt the University or constitute a danger to the health, safety, or welfare of members of the University community. The appropriate procedure to determine the future status of the student organization will be initiated within seven (7) business days. 4. Administrative Leave. The Title IX Coordinator may implement an administrative leave for an employee in accordance with University Human Resources Policies. Administrative leave for an employee is not an Emergency Removal under this policy. 9. Employees and Students Participating in the Title IX Process. All University employees and students must be truthful when making any statement or providing any information or evidence to the University throughout the process, including but not limited to the Investigator, Title IX Coordinator, the Hearing Panel and or the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer, and all documentary evidence must be genuine and accurate. False statements or fraudulent evidence provided in this process, including but not limited to the Investigator, Title IX Coordinator, Hearing Panel andor the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer, by an employee may be the basis for personnel action pursuant to CRR 370.010 or HR 601, or other applicable University policies, or if by a student may be the basis for disciplinary", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 49, "word_count": 500}

However, this obligation does not supersede nor expand any rights the individual may have under applicable state or federal statutory law or the U.S. Constitution. Nothing in this provision is intended to require a Party or witness to participate in the process. The fact that a determination has been made that a Respondent has or has not violated any policy is not sufficient grounds, by itself, to declare that a false statement or fraudulent evidence has been provided by a Party or witness. No employee or student, directly or through others, should take any action which may interfere with the investigation. Employees and students are prohibited from attempting to or actually intimidating or 67 harassing any potential witness. Failure to adhere to these requirements may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion or termination. 10. Rights of the Parties in the Title IX Process 1. To be treated with respect by University officials. 2. To be free from retaliation. 3. To have access to University support resources (such as counseling and mental health services and University health services). 4. To request a no contact directive between the Parties. 5. To have a Support Person of the Partys choice accompany the party to all interviews and meetings (excluding hearings) throughout the Title IX Process. 6.

To receive written notice of any delay of this process or limited extension of time frames for good cause which may include considerations such as the absence of a Party, a Partys Advisor or a witness; concurrent law enforcement activity; or the need for language assistance or accommodation of disabilities. 11. To be informed of the finding, rationale, sanctions and remedial actions. 12. To report the matter to law enforcement (if applicable) and to have assistance in making that report. 13. To have an opportunity to appeal the dismissal of all or a portion of a Formal Complaint, and appeal the determination of a Hearing Panel or other decision -maker. 14.

To have an Advisor of the Universitys selection appointed for a Party where the Party does not have an Advisor of their own choice at a hearing. 6. To testify at the hearing or refuse to testify at the hearing; however, if a Party or witness fails to submit to cross -examination at the hearing, the Hearing Panel shall not rely on any statement of that Party or witness in reaching a determination regard ing responsibility. The Hearing Panel shall not draw any inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a Partys or witnesss failure to submit to cross -examination. 7. To have an equal opportunity to present and question witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and present relevant evidence. 8.

Each Complainant and Respondent is allowed to have one Support Person of their choice present with them for all Title IX Process interviews and meetings. The Parties may select whomever they wish to serve as their Support Person, including an attorney or p arent. The Support Person may also act as the Partys Advisor. If requested by a student Party, the Title IX Coordinator may assign a Trained Support Person to explain the Title IX process and attend interviews and meetings with a Party. University Trained Support Person(s) are administrators, faculty, or staff at the University trained on the Title IX Process.

University Trained Support Person(s) are administrators, faculty, or staff at the University trained on the Title IX Process. A Trained Support Person cannot be called upon as a witness by a Party in a hearing to testify about matters learned while that individual was acting in their capacity as a Trained Support Person. 2. Advisors . Each Party may have an Advisor of their choice present at the hearing to conduct cross -examination and other questioning for that Party. A Party may not directly question any other Party or any witness; all cross -examination and other questioning on 69 behalf of a Party must be conducted by their Advisor. The Advisor may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. If a Party does not have an Advisor of their choice present at the hearing, the University will provide, without fee or charge to that Party , an Advisor of the Universitys choice to conduct cross -examination and other questioning on behalf of that Party. The Parties may not require that the assigned Advisor have specific qualifications such as being an attorney. At the hearing, a Partys Advisor may ask the other Party and any witnesses all relevant questions and follow -up questions, including those challenging credibility. An Advisor may conduct cross -examination and other questioning for a Party, and object to questions on limited grounds as specified in the Rules of Decorum. The Advisor may not make a presentation or otherwise represent the Complainant or the Respondent during the hearing. The Advisor may consult with the Party quietly or in writing, or outsi de the hearing during breaks, but may not speak on behalf of the Party, other than to conduct cross - examination or other questioning for the Party. Advisors who do not follow the Rules of Decorum will be warned or dismissed from the hearing at the discret ion of the Hearing Officer. 12. Investigation. If a Formal Complaint is filed, then the Title IX Coordinator will promptly appoint a trained Investigator or a team of trained Investigators to investigate. The burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rests on the University. For purposes of the Investigation, the University cannot access, consider, disclose, or otherwise use a Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professiona ls or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, unless the University obtains that Partys voluntary, written consent to do so for use in the T itle IX process. The Parties are not prohibited from discussing the allegations under investigation or from gathering and presenting relevant evidence. The Parties may present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence; all such evidence must be relevant.

The Parties are not prohibited from discussing the allegations under investigation or from gathering and presenting relevant evidence. The Parties may present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence; all such evidence must be relevant. A Party whose participation is expected or invited at a hearing, interview or other meeting, shall receive written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of all hearings, investigative interviews, or other meetings, with sufficient t ime for the Party to prepare to participate. The Parties may be accompanied to any related meeting or interview by a Support Person of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney; however, the Support Person may only participate in the proceedings as set forth in this policy. The Parties shall be permitted to inspect and review any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint, including the evidence upon which the University does not intend to rely in reaching any determination regarding responsibility, and inculpatory or exculpatory evidence whether obtained from a Party or other source and copies of recordings of all interviews conducted during the investigation, in sufficient time for the Parties to meaningfully respond to the evidence prior to the conclusion of the investigation. Prior to completion of the investigative report, the University will make available to each Party and the Partys Advisor, if any, the evidence subject to inspection and review in an electronic format or a hard copy, and the Parties will have ten (10) busi ness days to submit a written response to the Investigator, which the Investigator will consider prior to completion of the investigative report. 70 The final investigative report will fairly summarize the relevant evidence, and prior to a hearing or other time of determination regarding responsibility, the investigator will send to each Party and the Partys Advisor, if any, the final investigative re port in an electronic format or a hard copy, for their review and written response. If a written response is received from either Party, that response will be shared with the other Party and their Advisor, if any. All investigations will be thorough, reliable and impartial. All interviews shall be recorded. In the event that recording is not possible due to technological issues, the investigator shall take thorough notes and such notes shall be provided to the Par ties in lieu of recordings. The investigator shall document the reason the recording was not possible and such documentation shall become part of the Record of the Case. The investigation of reported sexual harassment should be completed expeditiously, normally within thirty (30) business days of the filing of the Formal Complaint.

A delay may also occur when criminal charges on the basis of the same behaviors that invoke this process are being investigated, to allow for evidence collection by the law enforcement agency. However, University action will not typically be altered or p recluded on the grounds that civil cases or criminal charges involving the same incident have been filed or that such charges have been dismissed or reduced. The Title IX Coordinator will not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal proceeding to begin the Title IX process. However, a Title IX investigation and resolution process may be temporarily delayed for good cause, which can inclu de concurrent law enforcement activity. In such instances, written notice of the delay or extension with reasons for the action will be sent to each Party. If delayed, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly resume the Title IX investigation as soon as notified by the law enforcement agency that it has completed the evidence -gathering process. The Title IX Coordinator will implement appropriate supportive meas ures during the law enforcement agencys investigation period to provide for the safety of all Parties, the University community and the avoidance of retaliation or sexual harassment. 14. Dismissal of a Formal Complaint. During or upon the completion of the investigation, the Title IX Coordinator will review the Formal Complaint and the investigative report, if available, to determine if the Formal Complaint is subject to dismissal. A Formal Complaint shall be dismissed: (1) if the conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint would not constitute sexual harassment, as defined in CRR 600.020 even if proved; (2) the conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint did not occur in the Universitys educatio n program or activity, or (3) the conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint did not occur against a person in the United States. A dismissal under this provision does not preclude action under other applicable University processes. A Formal Complaint or any allegations therein, may be dismissed at any time during the investigation or hearing if (1) the Complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the Complainant would like to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any alle gations therein; (2) the Respondent is no longer enrolled or employed by the University; or (3) specific circumstances prevent the University from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal Complaint or the allegations therein. Upon a dismissal required or permitted under this provision, the University will promptly send written notice of the dismissal and reason(s) therefor simultaneously to the Parties. Either Party may appeal a dismissal as set forth in Section U herein. 71 If the Title IX Coordinator determines there is a sufficient basis to proceed with the Formal Complaint, then the Title IX Coordinator", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 54, "word_count": 500}

The Formal Complaint will then be resolved through Informal Resolution or Hearing Pa nel Resolution, or the Academic Medical Center (AMC) Process, if applicable. 15. Informal Resolution. Upon the filing of a Formal Complaint, the Parties may choose to engage in Informal Resolution. The decision of the Parties to engage in Informal Resolution must be voluntary, informed, and in writing. The Parties are not required to engage in Informal R esolution as a condition of enrollment or continuing enrollment, or employment or continuing employment, or enjoyment of any other right. The Parties are not required to waive their right to an investigation of a Formal Complaint or a right to a hearing process, or AMC Process, if applicable. At any time prior to agreeing to (or in Administrative Resolution, rendering of) a final resolution, any Party has the right to withdraw from the Informal Resolution process and the matter will b e referred back for further investigation andor hearing as may be applicable. Informal Resolution is never available to resolve allegations that an employee sexually harassed a student. In Informal Resolution, which includes mediation or facilitated dialogue, a neutral facilitator will foster a dialogue with the Parties to an effective resolution, if possible. The Complainants and the Respondents Support Persons may attend the Informal Resolution meeting. The Parties will abide by the terms of the agreed -upon resolution. Failure to abide by the terms of the agreed -upon resolution may be referred to the Title IX Coordinator for review and referral to the appropriate University Process fo r discipline or sanctions. The Title IX Coordinator will keep records of any Informal Resolution that is reached. In the event the Parties are unable to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, the matter will be referred back for further investigation andor hearing as may be applicable. The content of the Parties discussions during the Informal Resolution Process wil l be kept confidential in the event the matter proceeds to the hearing process. The Parties agreement to participate, refusal to participate in, or termination of participation in Informal Resolution shall not be factors in any subsequent decisions regard ing whether a policy violation occurred. Among the resolutions which may be reached at this stage, the Respondent may voluntarily request to permanently separate from the University of Missouri System. If the Title IX Coordinator accepts the Respondents proposal, the Respondent must sign a Volu ntary Permanent Separation and General Release agreement to effectuate their separation and terminate the Title IX Process. 16.

Procedural Details for Administrative Resolution. The Parties may mutually choose to participate in a type of Informal Resolution called Administrative Resolution. The Administrative Resolution process is not available where a student has alleged that an employee sexually harassed the student. The Admini strative Resolution process is not available to Academic Medical Centers (AMC). The Administrative Resolution process is a process whereby the decision -maker will meet separately with the Parties and their Support Person, if any, and consider the evidence provided by the investigator, including the investigative report, and evidence p rovided by the Parties, and will make a determination of responsibility that is binding on both Parties. The decision of the Parties to participate in Administrative Resolution must be voluntary, informed and in writing provided to the investigator, and m ust include a knowing written waiver of their right to a hearing under the Title IX process. However, either Party may choose to leave the process and opt for a hearing at any time before a final determination has been rendered. In addition, the followin g will apply to the Administrative Resolution process: 72 1. The standard of proof will be preponderance of the evidence, defined as determining whether the evidence shows it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred. 2. The decision -maker has the discretion to determine the relevance of any witness or documentary evidence and may exclude information that is irrelevant, immaterial, cumulative, or more prejudicial than informative. In addition, the following rules shall apply to the introduction of evidence: 1. Questions and evidence about the Complainants pre -disposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainants prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainants prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. 2. Character evidence is information that does not directly relate to the facts at issue, but instead reflects upon the reputation, personality, or qualities of an individual, including honesty. Such evidence regarding either Partys character is of limited u tility and shall not be admitted unless deemed relevant by the decision -maker. 3. Incidents or behaviors of the Respondent not directly related to the possible violation(s) will not be considered unless they show a pattern of related misconduct. History of related misconduct by the Respondent that shows a pattern may be considered only if deemed relevant by the decision -maker. 4. A Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made or maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, may not be", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 56, "word_count": 500}

The decision -maker shall not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding such privilege has waived the privi lege. 3. In the Administrative Resolution Process, the Respondent and the Complainant may provide a list of questions for the decision -maker to ask the other Party. If those questions are deemed appropriate and relevant, they may be asked on behalf of the requestin g Party; answers to such questions will be shared with the requesting Party. 4. At any time prior to a final determination being rendered, the Complainant andor the Respondent may request that the Formal Complaint shift from the Administrative Resolution Process to the Hearing Panel Resolution Process. Upon receipt of such timely request from either Party, the Formal Complaint will shift to the Hearing Panel Resolution Process. 73 5. The Administrative Resolution process will normally be completed within sixty (60) business days of the decision -makers receipt of the Formal Complaint. Deviations from this timeframe will be promptly communicated to both Parties. 6. For good cause, the decision -maker in the Administrative Resolution Process may, in their discretion, grant reasonable extensions to the time frames and limits provided. 7. The Administration Resolution process consists of: 1. A prompt, thorough and impartial investigation; 2. A separate meeting with each Party and their Support Person, if any, and the decision -maker; 3. A written finding by the decision -maker on each of the alleged policy violations; 4. A written finding by the decision -maker on sanctions and remedial actions for findings of responsibility; and 5. The decision -maker shall be as follows: (1) For Student or Student Organization Respondents and Staff Respondents, the decision -maker will be the Title IX Coordinator; (2) For Faculty Respondents, the decision -maker will be as follows: (a) The Title IX Coordinator will act as decision -maker and make recommendation(s) on findings of responsibility and sanctions and remedial actions, if applicable, to the Provost who will be the final decision -maker. (b) The Title IX Coordinator has the option to request that a designee from the Provosts office act as decision -maker in Administrative Resolution and make recommendation(s) regarding findings of responsibility and sanctions and remedial actions, if appli cable, to the Provost who will be the f inal decision -maker. 8.

The sanctions of expulsion and termination are not available sanctions under the Administrative Resolution process in this Policy. Further, any suspension of a student under this Administrative Resolution process shall not exceed two (2) years. Any suspe nsion of an employee under this Administrative Resolution process may be without pay, but may not exceed ten (10) business days. 10. The decision -maker can, but is not required to, meet with and question the Investigator and any identified witnesses. The decision -maker may request that the Investigator conduct additional interviews andor gather additional information. The decision -make r will meet separately with the Complainant and the Respondent, and their Support Person, if any, to review the alleged policy violations and the investigative report. The Respondent may choose to admit responsibility for all or part of the alleged policy violations at any point in the process. If the Respondent admits responsibility, in whole or in part, the decision -maker will render a finding that the individual is in violation of University policy for the admitted conduct.

Appeal. 1. Grounds for Appeal. Both Complainant and Respondent are allowed to appeal the dismissal of a Formal Complaint or any of the allegations therein, or the findings of the Administrative Resolution Process, the Hearing Panel Resolution Process, or the Academic Medical Center pro cess.

The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer must not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or an individual Complainant or Respondent; if the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer does not believe that they can make an objective decision about a n appeal, they should recuse themselves and the Chancellor (or Designee) shall appoint an alternate Equity Resolution Appellate Officer to hear the pending appeal. All requests for appeal must be submitted in writing to the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer within five (5) business days of the delivery of the notice of dismissal or Administrative Resolution Decision, Hearing Panel Decision, or AMC Determination. 86 When any Party requests an appeal, the other Party will be notified and receive a copy of the request for appeal. 3. Response to Request for Appeal. Within five (5) business days of the delivery of the notice and copy of the request for appeal, the non -appealing Party may file a response to the request for appeal. The response can address that sufficient grounds for appeal have not been met andor the merits of the appeal. 4. Review of the Request to Appeal. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will make an initial review of the appeal request(s) to determine whether: 1. The request is timely, and 2. The appeal is on the basis of any of the articulated grounds listed above, and 3. When viewed in the light most favorable to the appealing Party, the appeal states grounds that could result in an adjusted finding or sanction. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will reject the request for appeal if any of the above requirements are not met. The decision to reject the request for appeal is final and further appeals and grievances are not permitted. The Equity Resolution Appe llate Officer will render a written decision whether the request for appeal is accepted or rejected within fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the request for appeal. If no written decision is provided to the Parties within fifteen (15) business day s from receipt of the request, the appeal will be deemed accepted. 5. Review of the Appeal. If all three (3) requirements for appeal listed in paragraph 4 above are met, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will accept the request for appeal and proceed with rendering a decision on the appeal applying the following additional principles: 1. Appeals are not intended to be full re -hearings of the Formal Complaint and are therefore deferential to the original findings. In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation and Record of the Case, and relevant documentation regarding the grounds for appeal. Appeals granted based on new evidence should normally be remanded to the original decision -maker for reconsideration. 2. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will render a written decision on the appeal to all Parties within ten (10) business days", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 71, "word_count": 500}

In the event the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer is unable to render a written deci sion within ten (10) business days from accepting the request for appeal, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will promptly notify the Parties in writing of the delay. 3. Once an appeal is decided, the outcome is final. Further appeals are not permitted. 6. Extensions of Time. For good cause, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer may grant reasonable extensions of time (e.g.: 7 -10 business days) to the deadlines in the appeal process. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will notify the Parties in writing if such extension s are granted. 87 22. Failure to Complete SanctionsComply with Interim and Long -term Remedial Actions. All Respondents are expected to comply with all sanctions and remedial actions within the timeframe specified. Failure to follow through on these sanctions and remedial actions by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect or any other reason, may res ult in additional sanctions and remedial actions andor suspension, expulsion, termination, referral to Dismissal for Cause process, or withdrawal of recognition from the Uni versity. Suspension will only be lifted when compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator. 23. Dismissal for Cause Referral. If the recommended sanction for a Regular, Tenured Faculty member is referral to the Chancellor to initiate Dismissal for Cause, the Record of the Case will be forwarded to the appropriate Faculty Committee on Tenure. Because the Dismissal for Cause proce eding is not a re -hearing of the Complaint, the Record of the Case will be included as evidence and the findings will be adopted for proceeding as detailed in Section 310.060: Procedures in Case of Dismissal for Cause in the Co llected Rules and Regulations. 24. Records. In implementing this policy, records of all Formal Complaints, the Hearing Process or Academic Medical Center Process, and resolutions (including Informal resolution and result therefrom), will be kept by the Title IX Coordinator. For the purpose of review or appeal, the Record of the Case will be accessible at reasonable times and places to the Respondent and the Complainant. The Record of the Case will be kept for seven (7) years following final resolution. In addition, a record of the response to all complaints of sexual harassment, must be maintained for a period of seven (7) years, including records of any actions, including Supportive Measures, taken in response to a report or Formal Complaint of sexual h arassment. In each instance, the University must document the basis for its conclusion that its response was not deliberately indifferent, and document that it has taken measures designed to restore or preserve equal access", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 72, "word_count": 500}

In each instance, the University must document the basis for its conclusion that its response was not deliberately indifferent, and document that it has taken measures designed to restore or preserve equal access to the Universitys education programs or activities. If the University did not provide a Complainant with Supportive Measures, the University must document the reasons why such a response was not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. Each Title IX Coordinator, including the Title IX Coordinator for the academic medical center, shall maintain statistical, de -identified data on the race, gender and age of each Party to a Formal Complaint for that university academic medical center, and will report such data on an annual basis to the President of the University of Missouri.

Intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, including charges against an individual for policy violations that do not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or Formal Complaint of sexual harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured b y Title IX, constitutes retaliation. 88 The University must keep confidential the identity of any individual who has made a report or complaint of sex discrimination, including any individual who has made a report or filed a Formal Complaint of sexual harassment, any Complainant, any individual who has been reported to be the perpetrator of sex discrimination, any Respondent, and any witness, except as may be permitted by the FERPA statute, 20 U.S.C. 1232g, or FERPA regulations, 34 CFR part 99, or as required by law, or to carry out the purposes of Title IX, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.

A statement that nothing in the Equity Process is intended to supersede nor expand any rights the individual may have under applicable state or federal statutory laws or the U.S. Constitution. 10. A statement informing a Party that all notices hereafter will be sent via their University -issued email account, unless they provide to the Equity Officer an alternate method of notification. If a Party does not have a University -issued email account, all notices hereafter will be via U.S. Mail unless they provide the Equity Officer with a pre ferred method of notification. 2. The Notice of Allegations will be made in writing to the Parties by email to the Partys University -issued email account, with a read -receipt or reply email requested. If a read - receipt or reply email is not returned within three (3) business days or the P arty does not have a University -issued email account, the Notice of Allegations shall be sent via U.S. Mail postage pre -paid to the last known address of the Party. Notice also may be provided in person to either Party. Notice is presumptively deemed del ivered, when: 1) provided in person, 2) emailed to the individual, or 3) when mailed. 8. Supportive Measures, Emergency Removal, Interim Suspension of Student Organization, and Administrative Leave 1. Supportive Measures. Supportive measures are non -disciplinary, non -punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the Complainant or the Respondent before or after the filing of a Complaint.

These measures are de signed to restore or preserve equal access to the Universitys education programs, activities or employment without unreasonably burdening the other Party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all Parties or the Univers itys education environment, or deter discrimination and harassment. The University will maintain as confidential any supportive measures provided to the Complainant or Respondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the a bility of the University to provide the supportive 94 measures. The Equity Officer is responsible for the effective implementation of supportive measures. Supportive measures may include: 1. Referral and facilitating contact for the Complainant or Respondent for counseling or other support services. 2. Mutual restrictions on contact between the Parties. 3. Providing campus escort services to the Parties. 4. Increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus. 5. Adjusting the extracurricular activities, work schedules, work assignments, supervisory responsibilities, or work arrangements of the Complainant andor Respondent, as appropriate. 6. If either Party is a student: (1) Referral of that Party to academic support services and any other services that may be beneficial to the Party. (2) Adjusting the courses, assignments, andor exam schedules of the Party. (3) Altering the on -campus housing assignments, dining arrangements, or other campus services for the Party. 7. Providing limited transportation accommodations for the Parties. 8. Informing the Parties of the right to notify law enforcement authorities of the alleged incident and offering to help facilitate such a report. 2. Emergency Removal. The Equity Officer may implement a removal of a Respondent from the Universitys education program or activity on an emergency basis, if the Equity Officer, after conducting an individualized safety and risk analysis, determines that an immediate threat t o the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of discrimination or harassment, justifies removal. 1. In all cases in which an Emergency Removal is imposed, the Respondent will immediately be given notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision of the Equity Officer either prior to such Removal being imposed, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possib le but no later than five (5) business days following the Removal. Any challenge by Respondent shall be made in writing and directed to the Equity Officer and must show cause why the Removal should not be implemented. The Equity Officer will forward the ch allenge to the Emergency Removal Appeal IndividualCommittee, which will make a final decision on Removal within three (3) business days. 2. Violation of an Emergency Removal under this policy may be grounds for discipline under applicable University conduct policy. 3. Interim Suspension of Student Organization. The Equity Officer may suspend, on an interim basis, a Respondent Student Organizations operations, University recognition, access to and use of the University campusfacilitiesevents andor all other University", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 81, "word_count": 500}

The Equity Officer may suspend, on an interim basis, a Respondent Student Organizations operations, University recognition, access to and use of the University campusfacilitiesevents andor all other University activities or privileges for which the Re spondent Student Organization might otherwise be eligible, pending the completion of the Equity Process when the Equity Officer finds and believes from available information that the presence of the student organi zation on 95 campus would seriously disrupt the University or constitute a danger to the health, safety, or welfare of members of the University community. The appropriate procedure to determine the future status of the student organization will be initiated within sev en (7) business days. 4. Administrative Leave. The Equity Officer may implement an administrative leave for an employee in accordance with University Human Resources Policies. Administrative leave for an employee is not an Emergency Removal under this policy. 9. Employees and Students Participating in the Equity Resolution Process. All University employees and students must be truthful when making any statement or providing any information or evidence to the University throughout the process, including but not limited to the Investigator, Equity Officer, Provost (or Designee), the He aring Panel, andor the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer, and all documentary evidence must be genuine and accurate. False statements or fraudulent evidence or refusal to cooperate w ith the Investigator, Equity Officer, Provost (or Designee), Hearing Panel, andor the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer by an employee may be the basis for personnel action pursuant to CRR 370.010 or HR 601, or other applicable University policies, or i f by a student may be the basis for disciplinary action pursuant to the provisions of CRR 200.010. However, this obligation does not supersede nor expand any rights the individual may have under applicable state or federal statutory law or the U.S. Consti tution. For purposes of this policy, refusal to cooperate does not include refusal to participate in any proceedings involving sex discrimination. The fact that a determination has been made that a Respondent has or has not violated any policy is not su fficient grounds, by itself, to declare that a false statement or fraudulent evidence has been provided by a Party or witness. No employee or student, directly or through others, should take any action which may interfere with the investigation. Employees and students are prohibited from attempting to or actually intimidating or harassing any potential witness. Failure to adhere t o these requirements may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion or termination. 10. Rights of the Parties in the Equity Resolution Process 1. To be treated with respect by University officials. 2. To be free from retaliation. 3.

To request that the hearing be held virtually, with technology enabling participants simultaneously to see and hear each other. 11. Role of Equity Support Persons. Each Complainant and Respondent is allowed to have one Equity Support Person of their choice present with them for all Equity Resolution Process interviews, meetings and proceedings. The Parties may select whomever they wish to serve as their Equity Suppor t Person, including an attorney or parent. If requested by a Student Party, the Equity Officer may assign an Equity Support Person to explain the Equity Resolution process and attend interviews, meetings and proceedings with a Student Party. 97 University Equity Support Person(s) are administrators, faculty, or staff at the University trained on the Equity Resolution Process. The Parties may not require that the assigned Equity Support Person have specific qualifications such as being an attorne y. An Equity Support Person cannot be called upon as a witness by a Party in a hearing to testify about matters learned while that individual was acting in their capacity as an Equity Support Person. The Equity Support Person may not make a presentation or represent the Complainant or Respondent during the hearing. At the hearing, the Parties are expected to ask and respond to questions on their own behalf, without representation by the Equity Support Person. The Equity Support Person may consult with the Party quietly or in writing, or outside the hearing during breaks, but may not speak on behalf of the Party to the hearing panelists. If the Equity Support Person fails to follow these guidelines, t hey will be warned or dismissed from the hearing at the discretion of the Hearing Officer. 12. Investigation. Upon the initiation of a formal investigation, the Equity Officer will promptly appoint a trained Investigator or a team of trained Investigators to investigate the Complaint. The burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rests on the University. The University cannot access, consider, disclose, or otherwise use a Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, unless the University obtains that Partys voluntary, written consent to do so for use in the Equity Resolution process. The Parties are not prohibited from discussing the allegations under investigation or from gathering and presenting relevant evidence. The Parties may present witnesses and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence; all such evidence must be relevant. A Party whose participation is expected or invited at a hearing, interview, or other meeting, shall receive written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of all hearings, investigative interviews, or other meetings, with sufficient time for the Party to prepare to participate. The Parties may be accompanied to any related", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 84, "word_count": 500}

The Parties may be accompanied to any related meeting or interview by an Equity Support Person of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney; however, the Equity Support Person may only participate in the proceedings as set forth in t his policy. The Investigator(s) will make reasonable efforts to conduct interviews with the Parties and relevant witnesses, obtain available evidence and identify sources of expert information, if necessary. The Investigator(s) will provide an investigative report to the Equity Officer. This report may contain the Investigators observations regarding the credibility of the Complainant, the Respondent, and any witnesses interviewed. The final investigative report will fairly summarize the relevant evidence. All investigations will be thorough, reliable and impartial. All interviews shall be recorded. In the event that recording is not possible due to technological issues, the investigator shall take thorough notes and such notes shall be provided to the Part ies in lieu of recordings. The investigator shall document the reason the recording was not possible and such documentation shall become part of the Record of the Case. The investigation of reported discrimination or harassment should be completed expeditiously, normally within thirty (30) business days of the filing of the Complaint. Investigation of a Complaint may take longer based on the nature and circumstances of th e Complaint. 98 13. Impact of Optional Report to Law Enforcement. A delay may also occur when criminal charges on the basis of the same behaviors that invoke this process are being investigated, to allow for evidence collection by the law enforcement agency. However, University action will not typically be altered or pr ecluded on the grounds that civil cases or criminal charges involving the same incident have been filed or that such charges have been dismissed or reduced. The Equity Officer will not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal proceeding to begin the Equity Resolution process. However, an Equity investigation and resolution process may be temporarily delayed for good cause, which can inc lude concurrent law enforcement activity. In such instances, written notice of the delay or extension with reasons for the action will be sent to each Party. If delayed, the Equity Officer will promptly resume the Equity investigation as soon as notified by the law enforcement agency that it has completed the evidence -gathering process. The Equity Officer will implement appropriate supportive measures during th e law enforcement agencys investigation period to provide for the safety of all Parties, the University community and the avoidance of retaliation, discrimination, or harassment. 14.

Summary Resolution. During or upon completion of investigation, the Equity Officer will review the investigation which may include meeting with the Investigator(s). The investigative report is not provided to the Parties during Summary Resolution, but is provided to the Par ties at either the Administrative Resolution or Hearing Panel Resolution. Based on that review, the Equity Officer will make a summary determination whether, based on the evidence gathered, there is a sufficient basis to proceed with th e Complaint that the Respondent is responsible for violating the Universitys Anti -Discrimination Policies. If the Equity Officer determines that there is a sufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, then the Equity Officer will direct the process to continue. The Complaint will then be resolved through either Conflict Resolution, Administrative Resolution, or Hearing Panel Resolution. There is no right to request reconsideration or appeal the summary determination to continue the process. If the Equity Officer determines that there is an insufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, then the process will end and the Complainant and Respondent will simultaneously be sent written notification of the determination and advised of their righ t to request reconsideration. The Equity Officer may counsel and suggest monitoring or training opportunities to correct for inappropriate behavior that does not rise to the level of a violation. The Parties may request that the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer reconsider summary determination ending the process by filing a written request with the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer within five (5) business days of notice of the summary determi nation. If the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer decides there is a sufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will reverse the determination ending the process and direct the process to continue pursuant to t his policy. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will simultaneously send the Parties notice of their decision. This decision to continue the process lies in the sole discretion of the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer and such decision is final. Furt her reconsideration of such decision is not permitted. If the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer agrees with the summary determination ending the process by the Equity Officer that there is not a sufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, then the process will end and the Complainant and the Respondent w ill simultaneously be sent written notification of the decision. This decision to end the process lies in the sole discretion of the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer and such decision is final. Further reconsideration of such decision is not permitted. 15. Conflict Resolution. The Parties may choose to engage in Conflict Resolution at any time during the Equity Resolution Process. The decision of the Parties to engage in Conflict Resolution must be voluntary, informed, and in writing. The Parties are not required to engage in Conflict Resolution as a condition of enrollment or continuing enrollment, or", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 86, "word_count": 500}

The decision of the Parties to engage in Conflict Resolution must be voluntary, informed, and in writing. The Parties are not required to engage in Conflict Resolution as a condition of enrollment or continuing enrollment, or employment or continuing 99 employment, or enjoyment of any other right. The Parties are not required to waive their right to an investigation of a Complaint or a right to a hearing. It is not necessary to pursue Conflict Resolution prior to pursuing the Administrative or Hearing P anel Resolution Process and either Party can stop the Conflict Resolution Process at any time and request either the Administrative Resolution Process or Hearing Panel Resolution Process. Conflict Resolution is never available to resolve allegations that an employee sexually harassed or engaged in sexual misconduct with a student. Upon receiving a request for Conflict Resolution, the Equity Officer will determine if Conflict Resolution is appropriate based on the willingness of the Parties, the nature of the conduct at issue and the susceptibility of the conduct to Conflict Resolution. In Conflict Resolution, which includes mediation or facilitated dialogue, a neutral facilitator will foster dialogue with the Parties to an effective resolution, if possible. The Complainants and the Respondents Equity Support Person may attend the Confl ict Resolution meeting. The Parties will abide by the terms of the agreed upon resolution. Failure to abide by the terms of the agreed upon resolution may be referred to the Equity Officer for review and referral to the appropriate University Process for discipline or sanctions. The Equity Officer will keep records of any Conflict Resolution that is reached. In the event the Parties are unable to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, the matter will be referred back to the Administrative or Hearing Panel Resolution process. The content of the Parties discussion during the Conflict Resolution Process will be kept confidential in the event the matter proceeds to the Administrative or Hearing Panel Resolution processes. The Parties agreement to participate in, refusal to participate in, or termination of participation in Conflict Resolution shall not be factors in any subsequent decisions regarding whether a policy violation occurred. Among the resolutions which may be reached at this stage (or at any point prior to a finding through Administrative or Hearing Panel Resolution), the Respondent may voluntarily request to permanently separate from the University of Missouri System. If the Equity Officer accepts the Respondents proposal, the Respondent must sign a Voluntary Permanent Separation and General Release agreement to effectuate their separation and terminate the Equity Resolution process. 16. Procedural Details for Administrative Resolution and Hearing Panel Resolution. For both the Administrative Resolution and Hearing Panel Resolution, which are described in more detail below, the following will apply: 1. The standard of proof will be preponderance of the evidence, defined as determining whether evidence shows it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred. 2.

The Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the Equity Resolution process. 3. The decision -maker has the discretion to determine the relevance of any witness or documentary evidence and may exclude information that is irrelevant, immaterial, cumulative, or more prejudicial than informative. In addition, the following rules shall apply to the introduction of evidence: 1. Questions and evidence about the Complainants pre -disposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainants prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainants prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. 100 2. Character evidence is information that does not directly relate to the facts at issue, but instead reflects upon the reputation, personality, or qualities of an individual, including honesty. Such evidence regarding either Partys character is of limited u tility and shall not be admitted unless deemed relevant by the decision -maker. 3. Incidents or behaviors of a Party not directly related to the possible violation(s) will not be considered unless they show a pattern of related misconduct. History of related misconduct by a Party that shows a pattern may be considered only if deemed rele vant by the decision -maker. 4. A Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made or maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, may not be used without that Partys express consent. 5. The decision -maker shall not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding such privilege has waived the privi lege. 4. The Respondent may not directly question the Complainant and the Complainant may not directly question the Respondent. However, if both Complainant and Respondent request the opportunity, direct questioning between the Parties will be permitted in the Hear ing Panel Resolution Process. Otherwise written questions will be directed to Hearing Officer, and those questions deemed appropriate and relevant will be asked on behalf of the requesting Party. 5. In the Administrative Resolution Process, the Respondent and the Complainant may provide a list of questions for the decision -maker to ask the other Party.

At any time prior to the deadline in the Notice of Administrative Resolution, the Complainant andor the Respondent may request that the Complaint shift from the Administrative Resolution process to the Hearing Panel Resolution process. Upon receipt of suc h timely request from either Party, the Complaint will shift to the Hearing Panel Resolution Process. 7. The Resolution Processes may proceed regardless of whether the Respondent chooses to participate in the investigation, the finding or the hearing. 8. The Administrative Resolution or Hearing Panel Resolution Process will normally be completed within a reasonably prompt time period, not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days, following the Equity Officers receipt of a Complaint. Unusual delays will be promptly communicated to both Parties. 9. For good cause, the decision -maker may, in their discretion, grant reasonable extensions to the time frames and limits provided. 17. Administrative Resolution: 101 1. Administrative Resolution can be pursued for any behavior that falls within the Universitys Anti -Discrimination Policies. Administrative Resolution may be used when both Parties elect to resolve the Complaint using the Administrative Resolution Process. 2. The Administrative Resolution process consists of: 1. A prompt, thorough and impartial investigation; 2. A separate meeting with each Party and their Equity Support Person, if any, and the decision -maker, if requested; 3. A written finding by the decision -maker on each of the alleged policy violations: (1) For Faculty Respondents by the Provost (or Designee) (2) For StudentStudent Organization Respondents by the Equity Officer 4. A written finding on sanctions for findings of responsibility: (1) For Faculty Respondents by the Provost (2) For StudentStudent Organization Respondents by the Equity Officer 3.

Each University will create and annually train a pool of not less than five (5) faculty and five (5) administrators andor staff to serve as hearing panel members in the Hearing Panel Resolution Process. The faculty hearing panel members selected by the C hancellor (or Designee) shall be selected from a list of no less than ten (10) faculty members proposed by the faculty councilsenate. Panelists are selected by the Chancellor (or Designee) and serve a renewable two -year term. Selection of hearing panel pool members shall be made with an attempt to recognize the diversity of the University community. Hearing Panel members from one University may be asked to serve on a hearing panel involving another University. The Chancellor (or Designee) will select a Hearing Panelist Pool Chair (Pool Chair). The Pool Chair randomly selects and coordinates the hearing panel members to serve on the Hearing Panel for a specific Formal Complaint. The Pool Chair may serve as a pa nel member for a specific Formal Complaint.

Both Complainant and Respondent are allowed to appeal a determination regarding responsibility in the Administrative Resolution Process or the finding(s) in the Hearing Panel Resolution Process. 1. Grounds for appeal. Grounds for appeals are limited to the following: 1. A procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter (e.g., material deviation from established procedures, etc.); 2. To consider new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal was made that could affect the outcome of the matter; 3. The Equity Officer, Investigator(s), or decision -maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or the individual Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; or 4. The sanctions fall outside the range typically imposed for this offense, or for the cumulative conduct record of the Respondent. 2. Requests for Appeal. Both the Complainant and the Respondent may appeal to the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer must not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or an individual Comp lainant or Respondent; if the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer does not believe that they can make an objective decision about an appeal, they should recuse themselves. For Student and Student Organization Respondents, the Chancello r (or Designee) shall appoint an alternate Equity Resolution Appellate Officer to hear the 110 pending appeal; For Faculty Respondents, the President (or Designee) shall appoint an alternate Equity Resolution Appellate Officer to hear the pending appeal. All requests for appeal must be submitted in writing to the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer within five (5) business days of the delivery of the Notice of Administrative Resolution or Hearing Panel Decision. When any Party requests an appeal, the other Party will be notified and receive a copy of the request for appeal from the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer. 3. Response to Request for Appeal. Within five (5) business days of the delivery of the notice and copy of the request for appeal, the non -appealing Party may file a response to the request for appeal.

The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will make an initial review of the appeal request(s). The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will review the request for appeal to determine whether: 1. The request is timely; 2. The appeal is on the basis of any of the articulated grounds listed above; and 3.

The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will reject the request for appeal if any of the above requirements are not met. The decision to reject the request for appeal is final and further appeals and grievances are not permitted. The Equity Resolution Appe llate Officer will render a written decision whether the request for appeal is accepted or rejected within fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the request for appeal. If no written decision is provided to the Parties within fifteen (15) business day s from receipt of the request, the appeal will be deemed accepted. 5. Review of the Appeal. If all three requirements for appeal listed in Paragraph 4 above are met, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will accept the request for appeal and proceed with rendering a decision on the appeal applying the following additional principles: 1. Appeals are not intended to be full re -hearings of the Complaint and are therefore deferential to the original findings. In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation and Record of the Case, Administrative Resolution determin ation, or Hearing Panel Resolution, and relevant documentation regarding the grounds for appeal. Appeals granted based on new evidence should normally be remanded to the original decision - maker for reconsideration. 2. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will normally render a written decision on the appeal to all Parties within ten (10) business days from accepting the request for appeal. In the event the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer is unable to render a wri tten decision within ten (10) business days from accepting the request for appeal, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will promptly notify the Parties in writing of the delay. 3. Once an appeal is decided, the outcome is final. Further appeals and grievances are not permitted. 6. Extensions of Time. For good cause, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer may grant reasonable extensions of time (e.g.: 7 -10 business days) to the deadlines in the appeal 111 process. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will notify the Parties in writing if such extensions are granted. 21. Failure to Complete SanctionsComply with Interim and Long -term Remedial Actions. All Respondents are expected to comply with all sanctions and remedial actions within the time frame specified. Failure to follow through on these sanctions and remedial actions by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect or any other reason, may re sult in additional sanctions and remedial actions through the applicable process. 22. Records. In implementing this policy, records of all Complaints, resolutions (including Conflict resolution and result therefrom, and Administrative Resolution and result therefrom), and hearings will be kept by the Equity Officer. For the purpose of review or appe al, the Record of the Case will be accessible at reasonable times and places to the Respondent and the Complainant. The Record of the Case will be kept for seven (7)", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 100, "word_count": 500}

For the purpose of review or appe al, the Record of the Case will be accessible at reasonable times and places to the Respondent and the Complainant. The Record of the Case will be kept for seven (7) years following final resolution. Each Equity Officer, including the Equity Officer for the academic medical center, shall maintain statistical, de-identified data on the race, gender and age of each Party to a Complaint for that university academic medical center, and will report such da ta on an annual basis to the President of the University of Missouri. Additionally, statistical data relating to each university in the University of Missouri System shall be reported on an annual basis to that universitys Chancellor and chief officers f or human resources, student affairs, and diversity, equity and inclusion; the academic medical center shall report such statistical data for the academic medical center on an annual basis to the Executive Vice -Chancellor for Health Affairs. Data relating to the University of Missouri System shall be reported on an annual basis to the University of Missouri Systems chief officers for human resources, student affairs, and diversity, equity and inclusion. 23. Dismissal for Cause Referral. If the recommended sanction for a Regular, Tenured Faculty member is referral to the Chancellor to initiate Dismissal for Cause, the Record of the Case will be forwarded to the appropriate Faculty Committee on Tenure. Because the Dismissal for Cause proce eding is not a re -hearing of the Complaint, the Record of the Case will be included as evidence and the findings will be adopted for proceeding as detailed in Section 310.060: Procedures in Case of Dismissal for Cause in the Co llected Rules and Regulations. 24. Retaliation. The University strictly prohibits retaliation against any person for making any good faith report of discrimination or harassment, or for filing, testifying, assisting, or participating in any investigation or proceeding involving allegations of discrimina tion or harassment. For matters involving discrimination or harassment other than sex discrimination under this policy, employees have an obligation to cooperate with University officials including the Investigator, Equity Officer, Provost (o r Designee), Hearing Panel, andor the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer. For matters involving sex discrimination under this policy, no person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law, or because the individual has made a r eport or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing. Intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, including charges against an individual for policy violations that do not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or Complaint of sexual harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or pr ivilege secured by law, constitutes retaliation.

Complaints alleging retaliation may be filed with the Equity Officer in accordance with CRRs 600.010, 600.040, and 600.050. Any person who engages in such retaliation shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion or termination, in accordance with applicable procedures.

If the identity of the Complainant is unknown, the Equity Officer may conduct a li mited investigation sufficient to identify to Complainant to the extent possible. In addition to making preliminary contact, the Equity Officer shall conduct a preliminary inquiry to gather enough information to make a threshold decision regarding whether the report describes a possible violation of the Universitys anti -discrimination policies. If the report describes a possible violation, the Equity Officer will refer the matter to the appropriate procedural process and provide appropriate supportive measures. If the report does not describe a possible violation, the matter will be referred to the appropriate non -Equity process. Under those circumstances, the Equity Officer may counsel and suggest monitoring or training opportunities to correct for inappropriate behavior that does not rise to the level of a violation. The preliminary inquiry shall be conducted promptly (typically within 7 -10 business days) of receiving the report. 7. Filing a Complaint . A Complaint is a document prepared by the Equity Officer after a verbal or written report of alleged discrimination or harassment becomes known to the University, or a document filed and signed by a Complainant alleging discrimination or harassment against a Respondent and requesting that the University investigate the allegation. As used herein, the phrase document filed and signed by a complainant means a document or electronic submission (such as by electronic mail or through an on line portal provided for this purpose by the University) that contains the complainants physical or digital signature, or otherwise indicates that the Complainant is the person filing the Complaint. All Complaints alleging discrimination or harassment under this policy will be investigated. The University may serve as the Complainant when the person alleged to have been subjected to discrimination or harassment in violation of the Universitys Anti -Discrimination policies chooses not to act as the Complainant in the resolution process or requests that the Complaint not be pursued. If the University decides to pursue a report of discrimination by a visitor, third party or applicant through the applica ble equity resolution process, the University will act as the Complainant. Where the Equity Officer prepares a Complaint, the Equity Officer is not a Complainant or otherwise a party under this policy. The University may consolidate Complaints as to allegations of discrimination or harassment against more than one Respondent, or by more than one Complainant against one or more Respondents, or by one party against the other Party where the allegations of discrimination or harassment, arise of the same facts or circumstances. Where this process involves more than one Complainant or more than one Respondent, each Complainant and each Respondent shall be entitled and subject to all of the rights and obligati ons set forth herein. 116 8.

The University will maintain as confidential any supportive measures provided to the Compl ainant or Respondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of the University to provide the supportive measures. The Equity Officer is responsible for the effective implementation of supportive measures. Suppor tive measures may include: 1. Referral and facilitating contact for the Complainant or Respondent for counseling or other support services. 2. Mutual restrictions on contact between the Parties. 3. Providing campus escort services to the Parties. 4. Increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus. 5.

All University employees and students must be truthful when making any statement or providing any information or evidence to the University throughout the process, including to the Investigator, the Equity HR Officer (or Designee), the Equity Officer, and or the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer, and all documentary evidence must be genuine and accurate. False statements, fraudulent evidence or refusal to cooperate with the Investigato r, the Equity HR Officer (or Designee), the Equity Officer, andor the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer by an employee may be the basis for personnel action pursuant to CRR 370.010 or HR 601, or other applicable University policies, or if by a student m ay be the basis for disciplinary action pursuant to CRR 200.010. However, this obligation does not supersede nor expand any rights the individual may have under applicable state or federal statutory law or the U.S. Constitution. For purposes of this policy , refusal to cooperate does not include refusal to participate in any proceedings involving sex discrimination. The fact that a determination has been made that a Respondent has or has not violated any policy is not sufficient grounds, by itself, to dec lare that a false statement or fraudulent evidence has been provided by a Party or witness. No employee or student, directly or through others, should take any action which may interfere with the investigation. Employees and students are prohibited from attempted or actual intimidation or harassment of any potential witness. Failure to adhere to these requirements may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion or termination. 11. Rights of the Parties in the Equity Resolution Process . 1. To be treated with respect by University officials. 2. To be free from retaliation. 3. To have access to University support resources (such as counseling and mental health services and University health services). 4. To request a no contact directive between the Parties. 118 5.

When the Complainant is not the reporting Party, the Complainant has full rights to participate in any Equity Resolution Process under this policy. 15. Additional Rights for Students as a Party: 1. To request reasonable housing, living and other accommodations and remedies consistent with Section 600.050.I. 2. To receive amnesty for minor student misconduct that is ancillary to the incident, at the discretion of the Equity Officer. 12. Role of Equity Support Persons. Each Complainant and Respondent is allowed to have one Equity Support Person of their choice present with them for all Equity Resolution Process interviews, meetings and proceedings. The Parties may select whomever they wish to serve as their Equity Suppo rt Person, including an attorney. An Equity Support Person is not required and any Party may elect to proceed without an Equity Support Person. If Complainant is a student, they may request that the Equity Officer assign an Equity Support Person to provide support throughout the Equity Resolution Process. University Equity Support Person(s) are administrators, faculty, or staff at the University t rained on the Equity Resolution Process. The Complainant may not require that the assigned Equity Support Person have specific qualifications such as being an attorney. An Equity Support Person cannot be called upon as a witness by a Party in a hearing to testify about matters learned while that individual was acting in their capacity as an Equity Support Person. 13. Investigation. Upon the initiation of a formal investigation, the Equity Officer will promptly appoint a trained Investigator or a team of trained Investigators to investigate the Complaint. The burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rests on the University. The University cannot access, consider, disclose, or otherwise use a Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, unless the University obtains that Partys voluntary, written consent to do so for use in the Equity Resolution process. The Parties are not prohibited from discussing the allegations under investigation or from gathering and presenting relevant evidence. The Parties may present witnesses and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence; all such evidence must be relevant. A Party whose participation is expected or invited at an interview or meeting shall receive written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of all meetings or investigative interviews with sufficient time for the Party to prepare to p articipate. The Parties may be accompanied to any related meeting or proceeding by an Equity Support Person of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney; however, the", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 111, "word_count": 500}

The Parties may be accompanied to any related meeting or proceeding by an Equity Support Person of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney; however, the Equity Support Person may only participate in the proceedings as set forth in this policy. The Investigator(s) will make reasonable efforts to conduct interviews with the Parties and relevant witnesses, obtain available evidence and identify sources of expert information, if 119 necessary. The Investigator(s) will provide an investigative report to the Equity Officer. This report may contain the Investigators observations regarding the credibility of the Complainant, the Respondent, and any witnesses interviewed. The final investigative report will fairly summarize the relevant evidence. All investigations will be thorough, reliable and impartial. All interviews shall be recorded. In the event that recording is not possible due to technological issues, the investigator shall take thorough notes and such notes shall be provided to the Part ies in lieu of recordings. The investigator shall document the reason the recording was not possible and such documentation shall become part of the Record of the Case. The investigation of reported discrimination or harassment should be completed expeditiously, normally within thirty (30) business days of the filing of the Complaint. Investigation of a Complaint may take longer based on the nature and circumstances of th e Complaint. 14. Impact of Optional Report to Law Enforcement . A delay may also occur when criminal charges on the basis of the same behaviors that invoke this process are being investigated, to allow for evidence collection by the law enforcement agency. However, University action will not typically be altered or p recluded on the grounds that civil cases or criminal charges involving the same incident have been filed or that such charges have been dismissed or reduced. The Equity Officer will not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal proceeding to begin the Equity Resolution process. However, an Equity investigation and resolution process may be temporarily delayed for good cause, which can inc lude concurrent law enforcement activity. In such instances, written notice of the delay or extension with reasons for the action will be sent to each Party. If delayed, the Equity Officer will promptly resume the Equity investigation as soon as notified by the law enforcement agency that it has completed the evidence -gathering process. The Equity Officer will implement appropriate supportive measures during th e law enforcement agencys investigation period to provide for the safety of all Parties, the University community and the avoidance of retaliation, discrimination, or harassment. 15. Summary Resolution . During or upon completion of investigation, the Equity Officer will review the investigation which may include meeting with the Investigator(s). The investigative report is not provided to the Parties during Summary Resolution, but is provided to the P arties at Administrative Resolution. Based on that review, the Equity Officer will make", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 112, "word_count": 500}

If the Equity Officer determines that there is a sufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, then the Equity Officer will direct the process to continue. The Complaint will then be resolved through either Conflict Resolution or Administrative Resolutio n. There is no right to request reconsideration or appeal the summary determination to continue the process.

The Parties are not required to waive their right to an investigation of a Complaint o r a right to Administrative Resolution. It is not necessary to pursue Conflict Resolution prior to pursuing the Administrative Resolution Process and either Party can stop the Conflict Resolution Process at any time and request the Administrative Resoluti on Process. Conflict Resolution is never available to resolve allegations that an employee sexually harassed or engaged in sexual misconduct with a student. Upon receiving a request for Conflict Resolution, the Equity Officer will determine if Conflict Re solution is appropriate based on the willingness of the Parties, the nature of the conduct at issue and the susceptibility of the conduct to Conflict Resolution. In Conflict Resolution, which includes mediation or facilitated dialogue, a neutral facilitator will foster dialogue with the Parties to an effective resolution, if possible. The Complainants and the Respondents Equity Support Person may attend the Confl ict Resolution meeting. The Parties will abide by the terms of the agreed upon resolution. Failure to abide by the terms of the agreed upon resolution may be referred to the Equity Officer for review and referral to the appropriate University Process for discipline or sanctions. The Equity Officer will keep records of any Conflict Resolution that is reached. In the event the Parties are unable to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, the matter will be referred back to the Administrative Resolution process.

The Parties agreement to participate in, refusal to participate in, or termination of participation in Conflict Resolution shall not be factors in any subsequent decisions regardi ng whether a policy violation occurred. 17. Administrative Resolution. 1. Procedural Details for Administrative Resolution . The Administrative Resolution process is a process whereby decision -makers will meet with the Parties and their Equity Support Person, if any, and consider the evidence provided by the investigator, including the investigative report, and evidence provid ed by the Parties, and will make a determination of responsibility that is binding on both Parties. For the Administrative Resolution Process, which is described in more detail below, the following will appl y: 1. The standard of proof will be preponderance of the evidence, defined as determining whether evidence shows it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred. 2. The decision -makers have the discretion to determine the relevance of any witness or documentary evidence and may exclude information that is irrelevant, immaterial, cumulative, or more prejudicial than informative. In addition, the following rules shall apply to the introduction of evidence: (1) Questions and evidence about the Complainants pre -disposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 114, "word_count": 500}

Such evidence regarding either Partys character is of limit ed utility and shall not be admitted unless deemed relevant by the decision - makers. (3) Incidents or behaviors of a Party not directly related to the possible violation(s) will not be considered unless they show a pattern of related misconduct. History of related misconduct by a Party that shows a pattern may be considered only if deemed relevant by the decision -makers. (4) A Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are mad e or maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, may not be used without that Partys express consent. (5) The d ecision -makers shall not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding such privilege has waived the privilege . 3.

Intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, including charges against an individual for policy violations that do not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or Complaint of sexual harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or pr ivilege secured by law, constitutes retaliation.

Any person who believes they have been subjected to retaliation is encouraged to not ify the Equity Officer. The University will promptly investigate all complaints of retaliation in accordance with this policy. The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute retaliation prohibited under this section. Charging an individual with a policy violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of any proceedings under this policy does not constitute retaliation provided, however that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, i s not sufficient to conclude that any Party made a materially false statement in bad faith. 126 SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (42 U.S.C. 16921) The Missouri State Highway Patrol maintain s the registered sex offender d atabase that can be found at the MSHP Sex Offender Registry.

Fire Any instance of open flame or other burning in a place not intended to contain the burning or in an uncontrolled manner. FIRE SAFETY The University of Missouri has adopted numerous policies to promote a safe living and working environment at all University locations. The full text of these policies as well as other important fire safety information can be found under Housing Policies and Procedures. 182 ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES USAGE Residents use or possession of appliances is restricted by the type, size and number permitted. Due to the high electrical demand of many appliances, Housing recommends residents limit the number of appliances used simultaneously to avoid causing a breaker to flip resulting in loss of power to the appliances. Roommates and suitemates should discuss appliances and who will bring what to avoid duplication, as on ly one microwave and refrigerator is allowed per room. All residents must abide by the following restrictions on electrical appliances in the residence halls and undergraduate apartments: No space heaters of any kind are permitted. One compact refrigerator that is 4.5 cubic feet or smaller is allowed in each bedroom (residence halls only). One microwave under 1000 watts is allowed in each bedroom (residence halls only). Cooking appliances allowed in student rooms include but not limited to: coffee makers, rice steamers, popcorn air poppers, crock pots, and slow cookers. Cooking appliances not allowed include but are not limited to: toasters, toaster ovens, electric grills (such as George Foreman grills), panini presses, pressure cookers (such as an InstantPot). All appliances with exposed heating elements and external oil or grease collection are prohibited. All appliances must be UL -Approved. Housing also requires the use of surge protector strips with a 15 -amp circuit breaker and safety reset switch. A surge protector strip should only be plugged directly into the wall not into an outlet multiplier or into another surge protector strip (no daisy -chaining). Overloading outlets and overusemisuse of equipment is prohibited. Total electrical usage should not exceed that which can be provided by one surge protector strip per outlet and should not overload, short or create line disturbances. SMOKE -FREE RESIDENCE AREAS In recognition of the health, safety and comfort benefits of smoke -free air and the responsibility to provide and maintain an optimally healthy and safe working and living environment for faculty, students, staff and visitors, the University of Missouri is smoke -free as of July 1, 2013. No smoking is permitted on any university property, in any university -owned buildings or in university -leased buildings or vehicles, including Residential Life Housing. Use of products including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, e -cigarettes, hookahs, pipes and water pipes are prohibited. Safe storage of such products is permitted, provided the product is not used on university -owned or -operated property. 183 OPEN FLAME AND FLAMMABLE MATERIALS Candles (with or without wicks),", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 156, "word_count": 500}

Use of products including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, e -cigarettes, hookahs, pipes and water pipes are prohibited. Safe storage of such products is permitted, provided the product is not used on university -owned or -operated property. 183 OPEN FLAME AND FLAMMABLE MATERIALS Candles (with or without wicks), incense, oil lamps, oilwax diffusers that sit on lightbulbs or other items with the capability of an open flame or burning ember are not permitted in any residence hall and are subject to confiscation and forfeiture. Resid ents are allowed to use UL - approved electric or battery -operated candle products. Examples include, but are not limited to, Scentsy and Scentbug products and battery -operated pillar candles. Incense oils must be enclosed. Reed diffusers in open bottles are not allowed because they ruin furniture and leave a permanent scent. The use, possession, display or ignition of fireworks or any type of explosive device is prohibited on university property. Tampering with or theft of fire safety equipment, including tampering with or discharging fire extinguishers, disabling bellshorns, activating a fire alarm when no emergency exists or covering or removing the batteries from individual smoke detectors, rem oving the entire smoke detector apparatus, or tampering with, hanging objects from, or decorating sprinkler heads in rooms of halls that are thus equipped are prohibited. HOUSING FIRE DRILLS In 2024 fire drills were conducted twice in each residence hall, including Tara Apartments. The 2024 Fire Amenities graph indicates each Residence Hall by name and the number of fire drills. Fire drills provide residents the opportunity to become familiar with the notification system as well as the evacuation procedures. During the drill and any other ti me that the fire alarm sounds residents should calmly evacuate the building and follow the instructions of staff and emergency personnel. Failure to vacate or in a ny other way interfere with the emergency response process will be considered a violation of MU Housing policy and handled accordingly. Students who require any type of accommodation to ensure their safe evacuation should contact the Residence Hall Coordinator or the Apartment Manager at University Student Apartments immediately upon moving into the facility so that the appropriate arrange ments can be made.

The initiation of the alarm notifies residents audibly and visually. Except for Tara Apartments any initiation of the fire alarm notifies an off -site response center that dispatches emergency responders to the location. One hundred percent (100) of the MU Housing owned residence halls and apartments are equipped with sprinkler systems. All MU Housing facilities have fire ext inguishers in compliance with the applicable code. Fire Safety Education and Training Programs for Students, Faculty and Staff Everyone at MU is responsible for fire safety. EHS works closely with the Columbia Fire Department, Campus Facilities, and campus departments to provide comprehensive fire prevention services to campus. These services include building inspections, maintena nce of fire suppression systems, fire extinguisher training, and promotional activities . Environmental Health and safety offer a Fire Extinguisher Use and Safety class made up of lecture and hands on opportunities. Students participate in extinguishing fir es after having learned about fire prevention and the proper use of fire extinguishers. Classes on fires, along with the types of fire extinguishers available, deciding which extinguisher to use, when to fight a fire with an extinguisher, and how to proper ly use an extinguisher are covered in this class. Contact EHS if you have any questions or desire consultative assistance about fire safety, the use of open flames and other fire related questions. 188 2024 Fire Safety Amenities in University of Missouri Residential Facilities Core Campus Residential Facilities Fire Alarm Monitoring by Off-site service Partial Sprinkler System1 Full Sprinkler System2 Smoke Detection Fire Extinguisher Device Evacuation Plans Placards Number of Evacuation (fire) drills each year3 Bluford X X X X X 2 Brooks X X X X X 2 Center X X X X X 2 College Avenue X X X X X 2 Defoe -Graham X X X X X 2 Discovery X X X X X 2 Dogwood X X X X X 2 Excellence X X X X X 2 Galena X X X X X 2 Gateway X X X X X 2 Gillett X X X X X 2 Hawthorn X X X X X 2 Hatch X X X X X 2 Hudson X X X X X 2 Johnston X X X X X 2 Lathrop X 4 X X X 2 Laws", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 160, "word_count": 500}

At this time there are no plans for future improvement in fire safety. 190 Procedures for Student Housing Evacuation In Case of Fire In case of a fire, for your safety and the safety of others, get out as quickly as possible, and leave the firefighting to the professionals. All residents and guests must evacuate when building fire alarm systems sound. When a fire alarm sounds, all occupants must immediately vacate the building via the suggested evacuation routes and go to the designated location. Students should familiarize themselves with the exits in the building and if there is a specific stairwell assigned for evacuation of their re sidence hall room, they should use that exit. Never use the elevators always take the stairs. Students who fail to vacate the building when an alarm sound endanger the safety of themselves and others and will face conduct action. What to do in case of fire When the fire alarm sounds, you must evacuate the facility. Never assume it is a drill or false alarm; treat each alarm as the real thing. Feel your doorknob before opening it. If the knob is hot, do not open the door. If the knob is not hot, brace yourself against the door and open it slightly. 191 If heat or heavy smoke is present in the corridor, close the door and stay in the room. Keep low to the floor if smoke is present. If you CAN leave the room Wear shoes; if possible, carry wet towels. Close all doors behind you to reduce the spread of smoke. If you are in another part of the building, do not return to your room. Go to the nearest exit or stairway. NEVER USE AN ELEVATOR. If the nearest exit is blocked, use an alternate route. If all exits are blocked, go back to your room and close the door. Follow the procedures described below. Never re -enter the building until staff indicates it is safe to do so. If you CANNOT leave the room If possible, open the window at the top and the bottom to let out smoke and let in fresh air. Do not break the glass. Smoke and fumes may be drawn in through the windows. You must be able to close the window if necessary. CALL 911, shout for help. Seal cracks around the door with towels or bed linens to keep out smoke. Stay near the floor when possible. Hang a sheet, jacket, shirt or other object in or outside the window to attract attention. If you discover a fire, do not endanger yourself Pull the nearest alarm box. Shout a warning. Repeat it. Leave the building and CALL 911, even if a small fire has been quickly extinguished. Close all doors, especially those leading into stairwells, which should never be left", "source": "2025-Annual-Security-and-Fire-Safety-Report-Crime-Statistics-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 162, "word_count": 500}

A written request for statistical information is made on an annual basis. The University compiles this information in the Universitys Annual Fire Safety and Security Report (AFSSR), which is published by MUPD. MUPD submits the annual crime statistics published in this report to the U.S. Department of Education (ED). The statistical information gathered is available to the public through the ED website. This report contains three years of crime statistics related to incidents that occurred on the University Campus; in certain Off- Campus buildings or property owned or controlled by the University of Missouri; and on public property immediately adjacent to and accessible to the Campus. This report also includes institutional policies concerning campus security, such as policies regarding sexual assault, alcohol and other drugs. The University distributes a notice of the availability of this Annual Fire Safety and Security Report by October 1 of each year to every member of the Univ ersity community through email. The notice includes a summary of the contents of the Annual Security Report, the address for MUPD and where the Annual Security Reports can be found on -line. Anyone, including prospective students and employees, may obtain a paper co py of this report by contacting the University of Missouri Police Department. 6 Reporting Crimes and Emergencies MU Police MU students, faculty, staff and visitors are encouraged to accurately and promptly report all cri mes, to the Universit y of Missouri Police Department or appropriate local law enforcement when the victim of a crime elects to, or is unable to, make such a report.

In certain circumstances , the caller may be requested to respond to MUPD to meet an officer or the officer may be able to take the required information over the phone. A police officer will gather the proper information, begin an investigation, and complete a written report. If appropriate , an investigator may be contacted to assist. If assistance is required from the Columbia Police, Boone County Sheriffs Department or Columbia Fire Department, MUPD will contact the appropriate unit. If it is determined the incident occurred outside of the jurisdiction of MUPD, the caller will be assisted in contacting the appropriate local law enforcement agency. If a sexual assault should occur, staff on the scene, including MUPD, will offer the victim a wide variety of services. Incident repo rts may be forwarded to the Office of Student Accountability Support or Office of Institutional Equity for review. 7 Campus Security Authorities While the University strongly encourages community members to immediately report all crimes and other emergencies directly to the MU Police at (573) 882 -7201 or 911, MUPD also recognizes that some may prefer to report to other individuals or University offices. The Clery Act recognizes certain University officials and offices as Campus Security Authorities (CSAs). The Act defines these individuals as : University Police Non -police personnel responsible for on -campus security. Official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including but not limited to, student housing, student discipline and campus judicial proceedings. An official is defined as any person who has the authority and the duty to act or respond to issues on behalf of the institution. Any individual or organization specified in a statement of the Universitys security policies as a place to report criminal offenses . Additionally , these individuals generally meet the criteria for being a campus security authority : Dean of Students Director of Athletics and All Athletic Coaches Faculty Advisor to a Student Organization Residence Hall Coordinator, Assistant or Advisor Coordinator of Greek Affairs An Ombudsperson (including student ombudspersons) Director of Campus Health or Counseling Center Victim Advocates Members of a Sexual Assault Response Team The function of a campus security authority is to report to MUPD or any of the below listed offices any crime report information they receive. CSAs are responsible for reporting allegations of Clery Act crimes that are reported to them in their capacity as a CSA. CSAs are not responsible for investigating or reporting incidents that they overhear students talking about in a hallway conversation; that a classmate or student mentions during an in -class discussion; that a victim mentions during a speech, wo rkshop, or any other form of group presentation; or that a CSA otherwise learns about in an indirect manner. While the University has identified several individual CSAs in the above category , we officially designate the following offices as places where University community members should report", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 2, "word_count": 500}

Any portion of the Daily Crime Log that is older than 60 days will be made available within two business days of a public request. Emergency Phones The University has installed emergency phones throughout the University of Missouri campus. Phones are in public areas of buildings including parking garages, elevators, residence hall complexes, administration buildings, and numerous outdoor locations. Emergency phones provide direct voice communications to the University Police Communications Center. Reporting Procedures MUPD encourages anyone who is the victim or witness to any crime to promptly report the incident to the police. MU will protect the confidentiality of victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking, to the fullest extent of the law. Since police reports are public records under the Missouri Sunshine Law, MUPD may not be able to hold reports of crime in confidence. However, the Missouri Sunshine Law does provide some exceptions. The MO Sunshine Law states, if any portion of a record or document of a law enforcement officer or agency, other than an arrest report, which would otherwise be open, contains information that is reasonably likely to pose a clear and present danger to the safety of any victim, witness, undercover officer, or other person; or jeopardize a criminal investigation, including records which would disclose the identity of a source wishing to remain confidential or a suspect not in custody; or which would disclose techniques, procedures or guideline for law enforcement investigation or prosecutions, that portion of the record shall be closed and shall be redacted from any record made available. Pursuant to Revised Missouri Statutes 610.100, a victim of RSMO Chapter 566 (Sex Offenses) may request that his or her identity be kept confidential until a charge relating to such incident is filed. With your permission, MUPD can file", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 3, "word_count": 500}

Pursuant to Revised Missouri Statutes 610.100, a victim of RSMO Chapter 566 (Sex Offenses) may request that his or her identity be kept confidential until a charge relating to such incident is filed. With your permission, MUPD can file a report on the details of a sexual assault without revealing your identity. The purpose of a confidential report is to comply with your wish to keep the matter confidential, while taking steps to ensure the future safety of yourself and others. With such information, the University can keep an accurate record of the number of incidents involving students, employees and visitors; determine where there is a pattern of crime with regard to a particular location, method, or assailant; and alert the campus community to potential danger. Reports filed in this manner are counted and disclosed in the annual crime statistics for the institution. Confidential reports for purposes of inclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics can generally be made through the Office of Institutional Equity. Anonymous reports are not the same as confidential reporting. If you are interested in reporting a crime anonymously, you can utilize the University Polices Silent Witness program. We do not attempt to trace the origin of the person who submits this form, unless such is deemed necessary for public safety. Persons may also report crimes through Crime Stoppers at (573) 875- TIPS (8477). Anyone may call the University Police at 573 -882-7201 to report concerning information. 10 Pastoral and Professional Counselors According the Clery Act, pastoral and professional counselors who are appropriately credentialed and hired by the University of Missouri to serve in a counseling role are not considered Campus Security Authorities when they are acting in the counseling rol e. As a matter of policy, the University encourages pastoral and professional counselors to notify those whom they are counseling of the limited voluntary confidential reporting procedures available to them for sexual assault reports. Pastoral Counselor: An employee of an institution, who is associated with a religious order or denomination, recognized by that religious order or denomination as someone who provides confidential counseling and who is functioning within the scope of that recognition as a pa storal counselor. Professional Counselor : An employee of an institution whose official responsibilities include providing psychological counseling to members of the institutions community, and who is functioning within the scope of his or her license or certification. 11 University of Missouri Police Department Role and Authority The University of Missouri Police Department (MUPD) is a professionally accredited police department . MUPD achieved accreditation through the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) and The International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators. The University of Missouri Police Department consists of more than 80 employees including 45 sworn police officers commissioned under Missouri State Statues 172.350 172.355. MUPD officers have the authority to enforce MO State Laws, City of Columbia Ordinances and University of Missouri Policies.

MUPD officers have the authority to enforce MO State Laws, City of Columbia Ordinances and University of Missouri Policies. MUPD officers are authorized under Missouri State Statutes to make arrests within the State of Missouri. MUPD shares a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Columbia Police Department which provides concurrent jurisdiction allowing MU Police Officers to enforce City of Columbia Ordinances. 12 The jurisdiction of MUPD includes property owned, leased or cont rolled by MU. MUPD has concurrent jurisdiction on city streets running through or adjacent to the campus. In addition, MUPD has jurisdiction over the following privately owned locations through a signed memorandum of understanding with the City of Columbia. All Greek houses associated with MU. St. Thomas More Newman Center, 602 Turner Avenue. Childrens House Montessori, 915 and 917 Tiger Avenue. Richmond Place Apartment s, 915 Richmond Avenue. Evans Scholars, 923 Tiger Avenue. The department also employs non -sworn, unarmed security officers and community service officers. The community service officers, and security officers patrol areas on -campus frequented by students and do not have powers of arrest. Community Service Officers and Security Officers do not have authority to enforce University Policies outside of parking regulations. The MU Police Department is the primary responder to all calls for service, emergency and otherwise, on th e University of Missouri Campus and the private locations listed above. The department operates twenty -four hours per day, seven days per week to provide law enforcement services. MISSION STATEMENT : The University of Missouri Police Department will establish partnerships with our community to create a safe learning environment to meet our communitys needs. SAFETY , OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY The MU community i s a great place to live, work and study. H owever, this does not mean that the campus community is immune from all the other unfortunate circumstances that arise in other communities. With that in mind, MU has taken progressive measures to create and maintain a reasonably safe environment on campus, through policies, programs and education. It is up to each one of us to live with a sense of awareness and use reasonable judgement when living, working or visiting MU.

This includes intraoperative radio capability, training programs, special events coordination, investigation of serious incidents and the shared 911 Center. The Columbia Police Department and Bo one County Sheriffs Department have arrest authority on -campus as well, although they normally do not exercise this power within University controlled buildings and MU On - Campus Student Housing without notifying or seeking the assistance of the University of Missouri Police Department. Additionally, MUPD often calls on the Columbia City Police, Boone County Sheriffs Department and the Missouri State Highway Patrol for assistance with large -scale events on -campus. During these events Officers, Deputies an d State Troopers from all agencies have full arrest powers. The University of Missouri Police Department participates in Mutual Aid Agreements that authorizes police officers and supervisors of the participating agencies to request mutual aid for incidents based upon a reasonable belief that such aid will enhance t he publics andor officer safety and efficiency. Agencies participating in these Agreements include the Columbia Police Department, Boone County 14 Sheriffs Department , and Veterans Administration Police. The mutual aid agreement does not apply to the investigation of most criminal cases, as MUPD provides the full range of police services. A MUPD officer is assigned to the Boone County Cyber Crimes Task Force. This officer serves as a forensic analyst investigating cyber- crimes and making arrests in those cases, on or off- campus. A MUPD Supervisor serves on the Mid -Missouri Bomb S quad as a Commander of the unit handling incidents both on or off - cam pus. Another MUPD Supervisor serves on the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force. MUPD has one K9 (Brass) certified in explosive detection. When requested, Brass and his handler will assist local law enforcement with investigating suspicious packages. The Missouri State Statutes of 172.350 172.355 allows the department to provide assistance to, or request assistance from, the three additional University of Missouri affiliated police departments in Rolla MO, Kansas City MO and St. Louis MO. When assistance has been formally requested, the assisting officers have arrest authority. Off-Campus Crimes Involving Student Organizations The University of Missouri has officially recognized student organizations that have non -campus housing facilities. These non -campus housing facilities, primarily fraternities and sororities fall under the jurisdiction o f the University of Missouri Police Department . MUPD is the primary agency responsible for responding to emergency and non -emergency calls for service at these locations. Recognized student organizations that may have functions at off campus locations that do not meet the Clery Act geography definition will fall under the jurisdiction of CPD. CPD may out of courtesy notify MU of any incidents occurring off campus. The University of Missouri expects all recognized student organizations to abide by federal, state, and local laws, and University regulations. Except for the non -campus housing facilities mentioned above, the University will generally be limited to conduct which occurs on the University of Missouri premises or at University -sponsored or University", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 6, "word_count": 500}

Except for the non -campus housing facilities mentioned above, the University will generally be limited to conduct which occurs on the University of Missouri premises or at University -sponsored or University -supervised functions. However, the University may take appropriate action, including, but not limited to the imposition of sanctions under Sections 200.020 and 200.025 of the Collected Rules and Regulations as well as the Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct in EducationEmployment Policy 600.020 . Timely Warnings Crime Notifications As an institution covered by the Clery Act, the Uni versity must send timely warnings - crime notifications on Clery Act crimes occurring in its Clery geography that are reported to MUPD, Campus Security Authorities or local police agencies, and considered by the University t o represent a serious or continuing threat to students and employees. The Timely Warning Crime Notification requirement applies to all Clery Act crimes and all require a case -by-case assessment as to whether the report presents a serious or continuing threat to the campus community. Crime Notifications are typically issued for the following crime classifications: murdernon -negligent manslaughter, major incidents of arson, robbery, a string of burglaries or motor vehicle thefts that occur in reasonable proximity to one another, and sex offenses. Incidents of aggravated assault and sex offenses are considered on a case -by-case basis, depending on the facts of the case and the information known to law enforcement. For example, if an assault occurs between two students who have a disagreement, there may be no on -going threat to other University community members and a Crime Notification would not be distributed. In cases involving sexual assault, they are often reported days, weeks, months or even years after the incident occurred, thus there is no ability to distribute a timely 15 warning notice crime notification to the community. Sex offenses will be considered on a case- by-case basis depending on when and where the incident occurred, when it was reported, and the amount of information known by law enforcement. MU Police Supervisors review reports on a daily basis for assessment of an on -going threat to the community. The MUPD Chief of Police as well as the Assistant Vice Chancellor for the Office of Institutional Equity andor their desig nee are responsible for making the decision to issue a Crime Notification. A member of the MU News Bureau will draft and dis seminate the Crime Notification. Crime Notifications are generally issued via blast email. All campus community members who have a valid email address issued by the University of Missouri Columbia will be designated to receive the Crime Notification . An institution is not required to provide a timely warning crime notification with respect to crimes reported to a pastoral or professional counselor.

All Crime Notifications will be provided to students and employees in a manner that is timely, that withholds the names of victims as confidential, and that will aid in the prevention of similar occurrences. Content of a Crime Notification The following information is typically included in a crime notification if available: A statement of the incident, including the nature and severity of the threat and the persons or locations that might be affected. Any connection to a previous incident(s). Physical description andor composite drawing of the suspect. Date and time warning was released. Appropriate safety tips. When issuing a crime notification, some specific information may be withheld if there is a risk of compromising law enforcement efforts to investigate andor solve the crime. Emergency Response and Evacuation Procedures Emergency Management at MU The University of Missouri Police Department is responsible for the MU Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). The EOP is an all- hazards disaster response and emergency management plan that complies with FEMA guidelines for Higher Education. The Emergency Management Plan provides the framework to structure the response and resources of MU academic and administrative community to any emergency affecting the University of Missouri. The University of Missouri Police Department activates the EMP when an emergency affecting MU reaches proportions that cannot be handled by established measures. This emergency may be sudden and unforeseen, or there may be varying periods of warning. The University of Missouri intends the EOP to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate contingencies of all types, magnitudes, and durations. Our priorities are: Life safety, infrastructure integrity, and environmental protection during an emergency . 16 Coordination with university departments to write, maintain, test, and exercise the EOP . Cooperation, Integration, and Mutual Aid with local, state and federal planning, response, and public safety agencies. A summary of the Universitys emergency response procedures is located at MU Alert. Included at this web site is detailed information regarding the Universitys emergency notification policy, including how to enroll in the emergency notification system to ensure you receive emergency notices on University email and personal cell phones . Emergency Notification Training and Exercise The University of Missouri is committed to ensuring the campus community receives timely, accurate, and useful information in the event of a significant emergency or dangerous situation on campus or in the local area that poses an immediate threat to the health and safety of campus community members. MU tests the emergency notification system components once every term as well as during the states March Tornado Drill. The University uses a tiered emergency notification system that uses Rave Mobile Alert , Alertus Beacons and desktop notification.

The MU Alert text messaging system is an emergency notification system available to s tudents and staff at MU that opt ed in to the emergency alert system. Alerts sent are simulcast to the University community via our MU Alert , the University Facebook page, MUPD Twitter, e- mail accounts and cell phone text. The University conducts at least one test of its emergency response and evacuation procedures . The test may be announced or unannounced. These exercises may include tabletop drills, emergency operations center exercises, or full-scale emergency response exercises. MUPD and Environmental Health and Safety develop an exercise scenario, schedules and coordinates the events with local, state, and federal response agencies as well as stakeho lders. In conjunction with at least one emergency management test each year, the University will notify the community of the information included in the Universitys publicly available information regarding emergency response and evacuation procedures. The University community will be notified of th ese procedures through the mass email system. All community members with a valid MU email will be designated to receive th is notification. T he University will also notify local ne ws media of the emergency procedures . The University conducts after -action reviews of all emergency management test documenting a description of the exercise, the date, the time, and whether it was announced or unannounced. In addition to the above procedures the City of Columbia conducts monthly tests of the tornado warning sirens. Several of these sirens are located on and adjacent to MU and can be heard in exterior areas of the campus as well as some interior locations. During these monthly siren tests, MU does not activate their emergency notification system. 17 Alerting Procedures Upon confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students and employees MU will, with out delay, determine the content of the notification and immediately initiate the notification system, unless issuing a notification will, in the professional judgment of responsible authorities, compromise efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency. The University has various systems in place for communicating information quickly. Some or all of these methods of communication may be activated in the event of emergency notification to all or a segment of the campus comm unity. These methods of communication include the use of electronic and cellular communication through the mass text notification system MU Alert, the Universitys e -mail system, Alertus beacons , desktop notification within a building and publ ic address system on police vehicles . If any of these systems fail or the University deems it appropriate, in person communication may be used to communicate the emergency.

If there is an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on campus, an institution must follow its emergency procedures. An institution that follows its emergency notification procedures is not required to issue a timely warning based on the same circumstances; however, the institution must provide adequate follow -up information to the community as needed. The University will issue periodic updates throughout the situation utilizing the same methods above. When the emergency is over, the University will issue an All Clear message. If the situation warrants, the University will establish a telephone call- in center to communicate with the University community during an emergency . Messages may direct individuals to evacuate, shelter in place, stay away from an area or contain other information pertinent to the situation. In the event of a weather emergency such as a tornado, The National Weather Service will provide guidance to the Boone County Emergency Management Office. Tornado warning sirens will be activated throughout the City of Columbia, including the University o f Missouri Campus. When a tornado warning is issued within Boone County, the University of Missouri emergency notification system automatically activates sending communication throughout the Rave Mobile Alert, Alertus Beacons and desktop notification. The University of Missouri emergency notification system is maintained by Police Communications along with certain members of the News Bureau. All MU Police Communications Officers are trained in the initiation process for an emergency notification. MU Police leadership: Chief, Major, Captain, Lieutenants, Sergeants and Officers in Charge are responsible for initiating the notification system. 18 Initiating the Emergency Notification System Generally, The University of Missouri Police Department will be responsible for confirming the existence of a significant emergency or dangerous situation. In certain circumstances, o ther first responders such as Fire Personnel, En vironmental Health Safety, Public Health Officials or Campus FacilitiesMaintenance Personnel will assist MUPD with confirming a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or staff exists on campus. If a significant emergency or dangerous situation is confirmed, a MUPD Supervisor will notify MUPD Communications to immediately activate the emergency notification system. If, in the professional judgment of first responders, issuing a notification potentially compromises efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency, the University may elect to delay issuing an emergency notificat ion. As soon as the condition that may compromise efforts is no longer present, the University will issue the emergency notification to the campus community. The most expedient way to report an emergency occurring on the University of Missouri Campus is to call 911. Individuals may also call the MU Police Department directly at 573 -882-7201.

Determining the Appropriate Segment or Segments of the Campus Community to Receive an Emergency Notification The MU Police andor local first responders on the scene of a critical incident or dangerous situation will assist those preparing the emergency notification with determining what segment or segments of the University community should re ceive the notification. If the emergency affects a significant portion of the entire campus, University officials will distribute the notification to the entire campus community. However, i f appropriate to a specific incident , the MU Alertus system does have the capability to activate Alertus beacons and desktop notifications to campus community members in the immediate area of the dangerous situation (i.e. a specific building or adjacent buildings.) In this instance, University officials will continue to monitor the situation an d may send s ubsequent notifications to a wider group of community members. 19 Emergency Notification Message The University of Missouri Police leadership consists of a Chief, Major, Captain, Lieutenants, Sergeants, and Officers in Charge. The responsibility to initiate the emergency notification system generally rests with the lieutenant, sergeant or Officer in Charge who is on duty at the time of the emergency. They will determine the contents of the notification based on each situation. MUPD leadership along with the MU News Bureau have developed a wide range of template messag es addressing a variety of emerg ency situations. The supervisor authorizing the alert will select the template message most appropriate to the ongoing situation . In situations where there are no pre -determined template messages in the system, the supervisor authorizing the alert will develop the most succinct message to convey the appropriate information to the community. The goal is to ensure individuals are aware of the situation and that they know the steps to take to safeguard their personal and communi ty safety. Alerting Procedures Parents, community members and others who do not have an account with the university can sign up for alerts in two ways. To receive emergency text messages, text GetMUalerts to number 67283. A message should be received confirming your number has been added to the system. To stop receiving messages, text STOP GetMUAlerts to number 67283. In addition to text messages, the public can sign up for email alerts through the Smart911 service. It is important to read carefully and choose the link below that applies to you to set up alerts from Smart911 properly. If you already have a Smart911 account and receive alerts through your local community, you must login with this link to set up alerts from the university.

Enrolling in the University s Emergency Notification System The University encourage members of the campus comm unity to enroll in the MU Alert System. University community members should regularly update their information at the same site. Emergency Evacuation Procedures The emergency evacuation procedures are tested at least twice each year. Students and employees learn the locations of the emergency exits in the buildings and are provided guidance about the direction they should travel when exiting each facility for a sh ort-term building evacuation. MUPD does not tell building occupants in advance about the designated locations for long- term evacuations because those decisions are affected by time of day, location of the building being evacuated, the availability of the v arious designated emergency gathering locations on campus, and other factors such as the location and nature of the threat. In both cases, MUPD staff on the scene will communicate information to students regarding the developing situation or any evacuation status changes. The purpose of evacuation drills is to prepare building occupants for an organized evacuation in case of a fire or other emergency. At MU evacuation drills are used as a way to educate and train occupants on fire safety issues specific to their building. During the drill, occupants practice drill procedures and familiarize themselves with the location of exits and the sound of the fire alarm. 20 At the sound of a fire alarm or if you are instructed to evacuate, leave your work area immediately and proceed to the nearest exit, and leave the building. If you are the first to recognize a fire situation, activate the alarm, evacuate to a safe location using the nearest exit, and dial 911. Remain Calm Do NOT use Elevators, Use the Stairs. Assist the physically impaired. If they are unable to exit without using an elevator, secure a safe location near a stairwell, and immediately inform MUPD or the Columbia Police Department of the individual's location. Proceed to a clear area at least 150 feet from the building. Keep all walkways clear for emergency vehicles. Make sure all personnel are out of the building. Do not re -enter the building. Shelter -in-Place Procedures If an incident occurs and the buildings or areas around you become unstable, or if the air outdoors becomes dangerous due to toxic or irritating substances, it is usually safer to stay indoors, because leaving the area may expose you to that danger. Thus, to shelter -in-place means to make a shelter of the building that you are in, and with a few adjustments this location can be made even safer and more comfortable until it is safe to go outside. If an incident occurs and the building you are in is not damaged, stay inside an interior room until you are told it is safe to come out.

If an incident occurs and the building you are in is not damaged, stay inside an interior room until you are told it is safe to come out. If your building is damaged, take your personal belonging (purse, wallet, access card, etc.) and follow the evacuation procedures for your building (close your door, proceed to the nearest exit, and use the stairs instead of the elevators). Once you have evacuated, seek shelter at the nearest University building quickly. If police or fire department personnel are on the s cene, follow their directions. A shelter -in-place notification may come from several sources, MUPD, Housing Staff members, other University employees, Local PD, or other authorities utilizing the University s emergency communications tools. 21 How to Shelter in-Place No matter where you are, the basic steps of shelter -in-place will generally remain the same. Should the need ever arise, follow these steps, unless instructed otherwise by local emergency personnel: If you are inside, stay where you are. Collect any emergency shelter -in-place supplies and a telephone to be used in case of emergency. If you are outdoors, proceed into the closest building quickly or follow instructions from emergency personnel on the sc ene. Locate a room to shelter inside. It should be: o An interior room; o Above ground level; and o Without windows or with the least number of windows. If there is a large group of people inside a particular building, several rooms maybe necessary. Shut and lock all windows (tighter seal) and close exterior doors. Turn off air conditioners, heaters, and fans. Close vents to ventilation systems as you are able. (University staff will turn off the ventilation as quickly as possible.) Make a list of the people with you and ask someone (hall staff, faculty, or other staff) to call the list in to MUPD so they know where you are sheltering. If only students are present, one of the students should call in the list. Turn on a radio or TV and listen for further instructions. Make yourself comfortable. 22 University Facilities Security Measures Academic and Administrative Buildings The University of Missouri Campus is part of the City of Columbia and, as such, is open to the public. The academic and administrative buildings are open to the public, at a minimum, during normal business hours. Most facilities have individual hours, and the hours may vary at different times of the year. Access to some of these buildings is also controlled by card access after normal business hours, and all these buildings have varied levels of access. A cademic and administrative buildings do not have a MUPD Officer assigned to them. However, MUPD officers patrol the academic and administrative buildings on a regular basis. For information about the access protocol for a specific building, see the building manager, a department head, or contact MUPD at 573 -882-7201.

For information about the access protocol for a specific building, see the building manager, a department head, or contact MUPD at 573 -882-7201. Residence Hall s All University residence halls have a 24 -hour security program that includes many security measures. Exterior residence hall doors, except those that lead past desks, are always locked . Students may enter locked doors of their hall using their ID card. The exterior doors that lead past desks lock electronically when the desk closes (typically 11:00 PM) and the hall is then closed to the public. Security devices are installed on ground floor windows and room doors have dead bolt locks and door viewers. Residents can protect themselves and their property by responsible decisions. Unescorted persons should not be given access to residence halls after hours; residents can access their own halls after hours by swiping their student id card through the card reader. Doors should not be propped open at any time. The names and telephone numbers and locations of on -call student staff are posted inside and on main exterior entrances of the residence halls; each resident should locate this information in 23 advance of an emergency. Wallet cards with on -call contact information are available from the residence hall information desk. Keeping every room door locked at all times will deter crime . Theft in a residence hall is often a result of an unsecured room or unattended belongings. Every security measure taken by the residence hall staff depends on the responsible actions of each resident for its effectiveness. Residence Halls do not have a MUPD Officer assigned to them. MUPD officers regularly patrol the exterior and lobby area of Residence Halls. Residential Life Staff enforce security measures in the halls and work with residents to achieve a community respectful of individual and group rights . Residential Life Staff, along with MUPD Officers also conduct periodic educational programs on prevention of various crimes, including sexual assault and acquaintance rape. Maintenance of Campus Facilities Facilities and landscaping are maintained in a manner that minimizes hazardous conditions. MUPD regularly patrols throughout campus and reports malfunctioning lights or other unsafe physical conditions to Facilities Management for correction.

Victim Confidentiality The University of Missouri is committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals involved in the investigation and resolution of a report involving sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence or stalking. MU is also committed to helping students and employees to make informed choices. With respect to any report under this policy, MU will make reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of participants, in accordance with applicable state and federal law, while balancing the need to gather informat ion to assess the report and to take steps to eliminate prohibited conduct, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects. Reports made to MU Officials and identifying information about the victim will be shared with a limited circle of MU Employees who need to know to assist in the assessment, investigation, and resolution of the report. All Employees who are involved with MUs response to reports of Prohibited Conduct receive specific training and guidance about sharing and safeguarding private information in accordance with state and federal law. 41 The privacy of Student education records will be protected in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), as outlined in MUs FERPA policy. The privacy of an individuals medical and related records generally is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA ). Confidentiality exists in the context of laws that protect certain relationships, including with medical and clinical care providers (and those who provide administrative services related to the provision of medical and clinical care), mental health provid ers, counselors, and ordained clergy, all of whom may engage in confidential communications under Missouri Law. Several offices and employees within MU fall under the guidelines of a confidential employee. When information is shared with a confidential employee or community professional with the same legal protections, the confidential employee (andor such community professional) cannot reveal the information to a third party except when an applicable law or a court order requires or permits disclosure of such information. For example, information may be disclosed when (i) the individual gives written consent for its disclosure, (ii) there is a concern that the individual will likely cause serious physical harm to self or others; (iii) the information co ncerns conduct involving suspected abuse or neglect of a minor.

An employees responsibility to report incidents of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, stalking based on sex, datingintimate partner violence or sexual exploitation falls under MU Policy 600.020. Under this policy every MU Employee is desig nated as a Mandated Reporter. Pursuant to the Clery Act, MU includes statistics about certain offenses in its annual security report and provides those statistics to the United States Department of Education in a manner that does not include any personally identifying information about individual s in an incident. The Clery Act also requires MU to issue timely warnings to the MU Community about certain crimes that have been reported and may continue to pose a serious or continuing threat to Student and Employees. Consistent with the Cler y Act, MU withholds the names and other personally identifying information of Complainants when issuing timely warnings or emergency notification to the MU Community, and in the maintenance of the daily crime log. MU will also maintain as confidential any accommodation or protective measures provided to the victim, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of the institution to provide the accommodations or protective measures. Prevention Programs The University of Missouri encourages the campus community to be responsible for their own security and the security of others. MU offers programs to prevent sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence , and stalking. These programs are comprehensive, intentional, and integrated programming, initiatives, strategies and campaigns intended to end sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking. These programs. Are culturally relevant, inclusive of diverse communities and identities, sustainable, responsive to community needs, and informed by research or assessed for value, effectiveness, or outcome; and Consider environmental risk and protective factors as they occur on the individual, relationship, institutional, community, and societal levels. Programs to prevent dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking include both primary prevention and awareness programs directed at incoming students and new employees and ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns directed at students and employees. 42 All incoming students and new employees are provided with programming and strategies intended to prevent rape, acquaintance rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking before it occurs through the changing of social norms and other approaches. These programs include (1) statements that MU prohibits such acts; (2) the jurisdictional definitions of related crimes; (3) the jurisdictional definition of consent; (4) options for bystander intervention that may be carried out by an individual to prevent harm or intervene when there is risk of prohibited conduct against another person; (5) information about risk reduction to recognize warning signs of abusive behavior; (6) information about the procedures that MU will follow after an incident of prohibited conduct has occurred ; the institutions definition of consent and the purposes for which that definition is used.

The Office of Institutional Equity and the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Center are primarily responsible for sexual assault education and awareness in collaboration with many offices at the University. Together, these offices offer a variety of programming focusing on sexual and gender violence. Consent Defined by Missouri Revised Statutes Section 556.061 (14). Consent: consent or lack of consent may be expressed or implied. Assent does not constitute consent if: (a) It is given by a person who lacks the mental capacity to authorize the conduct charged to constitute the offense and such mental incapacity is manifest or known to the actor; or (b) It is given by a person who by reason of youth, mental disease or defect, intoxication, a drug- induced state, or any other reason is manifestly unable or known by the actor to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of t he conduct charged to constitute the offense; or (c) It is induced by force, duress or deception. Consent Defined by the University of Missouri Consent to sexual activity is knowing and voluntary. Consent to sexual activity requires of all involved persons a conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Each person engaged in the sexual activity must have met the legal age of con sent. It is the responsibility of each person to ensure they have the consent of all others engaged in the sexual activity. Consent must be obtained at the time of the specific activity and can be withdrawn at any time. Consent, lack of consent or withdraw al of consent may be communicated by words or non -verbal acts. Someone who is incapacitated cannot consent. Silence or absence of resistance does not establish consent. The existence of a dating relationship or past sexual relations between the Parties in volved should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent. Further, consent to one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another. Coercion and force, or threat of either, invalidates consent. This definition of consent is used during an alleged violation and investigation of sexual assault, sex discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct per MU Policy 600.020 . For Clery Act reporting purposes, all sexual assaults that are reported to a CSA are included in the statistics submitted to the Department of Education regardless of the issue of consent. 43 Primary Prevention Programs These p rogramming initiatives and strategies are informed by research or assessed for value effectiveness or outcome that are intended to stop sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking before they occur through the promotion of", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 32, "word_count": 500}

Mizzou Bystander Intervention Initiative The University of Missouri is committed to creating a healthy and safe environment for all students. We are utilizing a new in -person training program, Mizzou Bystander Intervention Initiative, to promote community connectedness and civic engagement with t he overall goal of empowering students to get involved in situations where they can prevent, reduce, or respond to harm. Mizzou Bystander Intervention Initiative works to address multiple, interconnected issues including alcohol and other drug use, issues of bias and discrimination, interpersonal violence, and mental well- being. Risk Reduction With no intent to victim blame and recognizing that only abusers are responsible for their abuse, the following are some strategies to reduce ones risk of sexual assault or harassment (taken from Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network, www.rainn.org) Be aware of your surroundings. Knowing where you are and who is around you may help you to find a way to get out of a bad situation. Try to avoid isolated areas. It is more difficult to get help if no one is around. Walk with purpose. Even if you dont know where you are going, act like you do. Trust your instincts. If a situation or location feels unsafe or uncomfortable, it probably isnt the best place to be. Try not to load yourself down with packages or bags as this can make you appear more vulnerable. Make sure your cell phone is with you and charged and that you have cab money. Don't allow yourself to be isolated with someone you dont trust or someone you dont know. Avoid putting music headphones in both ears so that you can be more aware of your surroundings, especially if you are walking alone. 44 When you go to a social gathering, go with a group of friends. Arrive together, check in with each other throughout the evening, and leave together. Knowing where you are and who is around you may help you to find a way out of a bad situation. Trust your instincts. If you feel unsafe in any situation, go with your gut. If you see something suspicious, contact law enforcement immediately (local authorities can be reached by calling 911 in most areas of the U.S.). Don't leave your drink unattended while talking, dancing, using the restroom, or making a phone call. If youve left your drink alone, just get a new one. Don't accept drinks from people you don't know or trust. If you choose to accept a drink, go with the person to the bar to order", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 33, "word_count": 500}

If youve left your drink alone, just get a new one. Don't accept drinks from people you don't know or trust. If you choose to accept a drink, go with the person to the bar to order it, watch it being poured, and carry it yourself. At parties, dont drink from punch bowls or other large, common open containers. Watch out for your friends, and vice versa. If a friend seems out of it, is way too intoxicated for amount of alcohol theyve had, or is acting out of character, get him or her to a safe place immediately. If you suspect you or a friend has been drugged, contact law enforcement immediately (local authorities can be reached by calling 911 in most areas of the U.S.). Be explicit with doctors so they can give you the correct tests (you will need a urine test and possibly others). If you need to get out of an uncomfortable or scary situation here are some things that you can try: Remember that being in this situation is not your fault. You did not do anything wrong, it is the person who is making you uncomfortable that is to blame. Be true to yourself. Don't feel obligated to do anything you don't want to do. I don't want to is always a good enough reason. Do what feels right to you and what you are comfortable with. Have a code word with your friends or family so that if you dont feel comfortable you can call them and communicate your discomfort without the person you are with 45 knowing. Your friends or family can then come to get you or make up an excuse for you to leave. Lie. If you dont want to hurt the persons feelings it is better to lie and make up a reason to leave than to stay and be uncomfortable, scared, or worse. Some excuses you could use are needing to take care of a friend or family member, not feeling well, having somewhere else that you need to be, etc. Try to think of an escape route . How would you try to get out of the room? Where are the doors? Windows? Are there people around who might be able to help you? Is there an emergency phone nearby ? If you andor the other person have been drinking, you can say that you would rather wait until you both have your full judgment before doing anything you may regret later.

These measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the Universitys education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other Party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all Parties or the Universitys education environment, or deter sexual harassment. The University will maintain as confidential any Supportive Measures provided to the Complainant or Respondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of the University to provide the Supportive Measures. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for the effective implementation of Supportive Measures. Supportive Measures may include: Referral and facilitating contact for the Complainant or Respondent for counseling or other support services. Mutual restrictions on contact between the Parties. Providing campus escort services to the Parties. Increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus. Adjusting the extracurricular activities, work schedules, work assignments, supervisory responsibilities, or work arrangements of the Complainant andor the Respondent, as appropriate.

The Title IX Coordinator may implement a removal of a Respondent from the Universitys education program or activity on an emergency basis, if the Title IX Coordinator, after conducting an individualized safety and risk analysis, determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual harassment, justifies removal. In all cases in which an Emergency Removal is imposed, the Respondent will immediately be given notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision of the Title IX Coordinator either prior to such Removal being imposed, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible but no later than five (5) business days following the Removal. Any challenge by Respondent shall be made in writing and directed to the Title IX Coordinator and must show cause why the Removal should not be implemented. The Title IX Coordinator w ill forward the challenge to the Emergency Removal Appeal IndividualCommittee, which will make a final decision on Removal within three (3) business days. Violation of an Emergency Removal under this policy may be grounds for discipline under applicable University conduct policy. Interim Suspension of Student Organization. The Title IX Coordinator may suspend, on an interim basis, a Respondent Student Organizations operations, University recognition, access to and use of the University campusfacilitiesevents andor all other University activities or privileges for which the Respondent Student Organization might otherwise be eligible, pending the completion of the Title IX Process when the Title IX Coordinator finds and believes from available information that the presence of the student organization on campus would seriously disrupt the University or constitute a danger to the health, safety, or welfare of members of the University community. The appropriate procedure to determine the future status of the student organization will be initiated within seven (7) business days. Administrative Leave. The Title IX Coordinator may implement an administrative leave for an employee in accordance with University Human Resources Policies.

All University employees and students must be truthful when making any statement or providing any information or evidence to the University throughout the process, including but not limited to the Investigator, Title IX Coordinator, the Hearing Panel and or the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer, and all documentary evidence must be genuine and accurate. False statements or fraudulent evidence provided in this process, including but not limited to the Investigator, Title IX Coordinator, Hearing Panel andor the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer, by an employee may be the basis for personnel action pursuant to CRR 370.010 or HR 601, or other applicable University policies, or if by a student may be the basis for disciplinary action pursuant to the provisions of CRR 200.010. However, this obligation does not supersede nor expand any rights the individual may have under applicable state or federal statutory law or the U.S. Constitution. Nothing in this provision is intended to require a Party or witness to participate in the process. The fact that a determination has been made that a Respondent has or has not violated any policy is not sufficient grounds, by itself, to declare that a false statement or fraudulent evidence has been provided by a Party or witness. No employee or student, directly or through others, should take any action which may interfere with the investigation. Employees and students are prohibited from attempting to or actually intimidating or 62 harassing any potential witness. Failure to adhere to these requirements may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion or termination.

If requested by a student Party, the Title IX Coordinator may assign a Trained Support Person to explain the Title IX process and attend interviews and meetings with a Party. University Trained Support Person(s) are administrators, faculty, or staff at the University trained on the Title IX Process. A Trained Support Person cannot be called upon as a witness by a Party in a hearing to testify about matters learned while that individual was acting in their capacity as a Trained Support Person. Advisors . Each Party may have an Advisor of their choice present at the hearing to conduct cross - examination and other questioning for that Party. A Party may not directly question any other Party or any witness; all cross -examination and other questioning on behalf of a Party must be conducted by their Advisor. The Advisor may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. If a Party does not have an Advisor of their choice present at the hearing, the University will provide, without fee or charge to that Party, an Advisor of the Universitys choice to conduct cross -examination and other questioning on 64 behalf of that Party. The Parties may not require that the assigned Advisor have specific qualifications such as being an attorney. At the hearing, a Partys Advisor may ask the other Party and any witnesses all relevant questions and follow -up questions, including those challenging credibility. An Advisor may conduct cross -examination and other questioning for a Party, and object to questions on limited grounds as specified in the Rules of Decorum. The Advisor may not make a presentation or otherwise represent the Complainant or the Respondent during the hearing. The Advisor may consult with the Party quietly or in writing, or outside the hearing during breaks, but may not speak on behalf of the Party, other than to conduct cross - examination or other questioning for the Party. Advisors who do not follow the Rules of Decorum will be warned or dismissed from the hearing at the discretion of the Hearing Officer. Investigation. If a Formal Complaint is filed, then the Title IX Coordinator will promptly appoint a trained Investigator or a team of trained Investigators to investigate. The burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rests on the University. For purposes of the Investigation, the University cannot access, consider, disclose, or otherwise use a Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, unless the University obtains that Partys voluntary, written consent", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 50, "word_count": 500}

The Parties are not prohibited from discussing the allegations under investigation or from gathering and presenting relevant evidence. The Parties may present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence; all such evidence must be relevant. A Party whose participation is expected or invited at a hearing, interview or other meeting, shall receive written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of all hearings, investigative interviews, or other meetings, with sufficient t ime for the Party to prepare to participate. The Parties may be accompanied to any related meeting or interview by a Support Person of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney; however, the Support Person may only participate in the proceedings as set forth in this policy. The Parties shall be permitted to inspect and review any evidence obtained as part of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint, including the evidence upon which the University does not intend to rely in reaching any determination regarding responsibility, and inculpatory or exculpatory evidence whether obtained from a Party or other source and copies of recordings of all interviews conducted during the investigation, in sufficient time for the Parties to meaningfully respond to the evidence prior to the conclusion of the investigation. Prior to completion of the investigative report, the University will make available to each Party and the Partys Advisor, if any, the evidence subject to inspection and review in an electronic format or a hard copy, and the Parties will have ten (10) busi ness days to submit a written response to the Investigator, which the Investigator will consider prior to completion of the investigative report. 65 The final investigative report will fairly summarize the relevant evidence, and prior to a hearing or other time of determination regarding responsibility, the investigator will send to each Party and the Partys Advisor, if any, the final investigative report in an electronic format or a hard copy, for their review and written response. If a written response is received from either Party, that response will be shared with the other Party and their Advisor, if any. All investigations will be thorough, reliable and impartial. All interviews shall be recorded. In the event that recording is not possible due to technological issues, the investigator shall take thorough notes and such notes shall be provided to the Par ties in lieu of recordings.

The investigation of reported sexual harassment should be completed expeditiously, normally within thirty (30) business days of the filing of the Formal Complaint. Investigation of a Formal Complaint may take longer based on the nature and circumstances of the Formal Complaint. Impact of Optional Report to Law Enforcement . A delay may also occur when criminal charges on the basis of the same behaviors that invoke this process are being investigated, to allow for evidence collection by the law enforcement agency. However, University action will not typically be altered or precluded on the grounds that civil cases or criminal charges involving the same incident have been filed or that such charges have been dismissed or reduced. The Title IX Coordinator will not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal proceeding to begin the Title IX process. However, a Title IX investigation and resolution process may be temporarily delayed for good cause, which can inclu de concurrent law enforcement activity. In such instances, written notice of the delay or extension with reasons for the action will be sent to each Party. If delayed, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly resume the Title IX investigation as soon as notified by the law enforcement agency that it has completed the evidence-gathering process. The Title IX Coordinator will implement appropriate supportive measures during the law enforcement agencys investigation period to provid e for the safety of all Parties, the University community and the avoidance of retaliation or sexual harassment. Dismissal of a Formal Complaint. During or upon the completion of the investigation, the Title IX Coordinator will review the Formal Complaint and the investigative report, if available, to determine if the Formal Complaint is subject to dismissal. A Formal Complaint shall be dismissed: (1) if the conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint would not constitute sexual harassment, as defined in CRR 600.020 even if proved; (2) the conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint did not occur in the Universitys educatio n program or activity, or (3) the conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint did not occur against a person in the United States. A dismissal under this provision does not preclude action under other applicable University processes. A Formal Complaint or any allegations therein, may be dismissed at any time during the investigation or hearing if (1) the Complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the Complainant would like to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any alle gations therein; (2) the Respondent is no longer enrolled or employed by the University; or (3) specific circumstances prevent the University from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal Complaint or the allegations therein. 66 Upon a dismissal required or permitted under this provision, the University", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 52, "word_count": 500}

Either Party may appeal a dismissal as set forth in Section U herein. If the Title IX Coordinator determines there is a sufficient basis to proceed with the Formal Complaint, then the Title IX Coordinator will direct the process to continue. The Formal Complaint will then be resolved through Informal Resolution or Hearing Panel Resolution, or the Academic Medical Center (AMC) Process, if applicable. Informal Resolution. Upon the filing of a Formal Complaint, the Parties may choose to engage in Informal Resolution. The decision of the Parties to engage in Informal Resolution must be voluntary, informed, and in writing. The Parties are not required to engage in Informal Resolution as a condition of enrollment or continuing enrollment, or employment or continuing employment, or enjoyment of any other right. The Parties are not required to waive their right to an investigation of a Formal Complaint or a right to a hearing process, or AMC Process, if applicable. At any time prior to agreeing to (or in Administrative Resolution, rendering of) a final resolution, any Party has the right to withdraw from the Informal Resolution process and the matter will be referred back for further investigation andor hearing as may be applicable. Informal Resolution is never available to resolve allegations that an employee sexually harassed a student. In Informal Resolution, which includes mediation or facilitated dialogue, a neutral facilitator will foster a dialogue with the Parties to an effective resolution, if possible. The Complainants and the Respondents Support Persons may attend the Informal Resolution meeting. The Parties will abide by the terms of the agreed -upon resolution. Failure to abide by the terms of the agreed -upon resolution may be referred to the Title IX Coordinator for review and referral to the appropriate University Process fo r discipline or sanctions. The Title IX Coordinator will keep records of any Informal Resolution that is reached. In the event the Parties are unable to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, the matter will be referred back for further investigation andor hearing as may be applicable. The content of the Parties discussions during the Informal Resolution Process wil l be kept confidential in the event the matter proceeds to the hearing process. The Parties agreement to participate, refusal to participate in, or termination of participation in Informal Resolution shall not be factors in any subsequent decisions regard ing whether a policy violation occurred.

If the Title IX Coordinator accepts the Respondents proposal, the Respondent must sign a Volu ntary Permanent Separation and General Release agreement to effectuate their separation and terminate the Title IX Process. Procedural Details for Administrative Resolution. The Parties may mutually choose to participate in a type of Informal Resolution called Administrative Resolution. The Administrative Resolution process is not available where a student has alleged that an employee sexually harassed the student. The Admini strative Resolution process is not available to Academic Medical Centers (AMC). The Administrative Resolution process is a process whereby the decision -maker will meet separately with the Parties and their Support Person, if any, and consider the evidence provided by the 67 investigator, including the investigative report, and evidence provided by the Parties, and will make a determination of responsibility that is binding on both Parties. The decision of the Parties to participate in Administrative Resolution must be volunt ary, informed and in writing provided to the investigator, and must include a knowing written waiver of their right to a hearing under the Title IX process. However, either Party may choose to leave the process and opt for a hearing at any time before a final determination has been rendered. In addition, the following will apply to the Administrative Resolution process: The standard of proof will be preponderance of the evidence, defined as determining whether the evidence shows it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred. The decision -maker has the discretion to determine the relevance of any witness or documentary evidence and may exclude information that is irrelevant, immaterial, cumulative, or more prejudicial than informative. In addition, the following rules shall app ly to the introduction of evidence: Questions and evidence about the Complainants pre -disposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainants prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainants prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. Character evidence is information that does not directly relate to the facts at issue, but instead reflects upon the reputation, personality, or qualities of an individual, including honesty. Such evidence regarding either Partys character is of limited utility and shall not be admitted unless deemed relevant by the decision -maker. Incidents or behaviors of the Respondent not directly related to the possible violation(s) will not be considered unless they show a pattern of related misconduct. History of related misconduct by the Respondent that shows a pattern may be considered only if deemed relevant by the decision -maker.

The decision -maker shall not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding such privilege has waived the privi lege. In the Administrative Resolution Process, the Respondent and the Complainant may provide a list of questions for the decision -maker to ask the other Party. If those questions are deemed appropriate and relevant, they may be asked on behalf of the requestin g Party; answers to such questions will be shared with the requesting Party. At any time prior to a final determination being rendered, the Complainant andor the Respondent may request that the Formal Complaint shift from the Administrative Resolution Process to the Hearing Panel Resolution Process. Upon receipt of such timely req uest from either Party, the Formal Complaint will shift to the Hearing Panel Resolution Process. 68 The Administrative Resolution process will normally be completed within sixty (60) business days of the decision -makers receipt of the Formal Complaint. Deviations from this timeframe will be promptly communicated to both Parties. For good cause, the decision -maker in the Administrative Resolution Process may, in their discretion, grant reasonable extensions to the time frames and limits provided. The Administration Resolution process consists of: A prompt, thorough and impartial investigation; A separate meeting with each Party and their Support Person, if any, and the decision -maker; A written finding by the decision -maker on each of the alleged policy violations; A written finding by the decision -maker on sanctions and remedial actions for findings of responsibility; and The decision -maker shall be as follows: (1) For Student or Student Organization Respondents and Staff Respondents, the decision -maker will be the Title IX Coordinator; (2) For Faculty Respondents, the decision -maker will be as follows: (a) The Title IX Coordinator will act as decision -maker and make recommendation(s) on findings of responsibility and sanctions and remedial actions, if applicable, to the Provost who will be the final decision -maker. (b) The Title IX Coordinator has the option to request that a designee from the Provosts office act as decision -maker in Administrative Resolution and make recommendation(s) regarding findings of responsibility and sanctions and remedial actions, if applicable, to the Provost who will be the final decision -maker.

The sanctions of expulsion and termination are not available sanctions under the Administrative Resolution process in this Policy. Further, any suspension of a student under this Administrative Resolution process shall not exceed two (2) years. Any suspension of an employee under this Administrative Resolution process may be without pay, but may not exceed ten (10) business days. The decision -maker can, but is not required to, meet with and question the Investigator and any identified witnesses. The decision -maker may request that the Investigator conduct additional interviews andor gather additional information. The decision -make r will meet separately with the Complainant and the Respondent, and their Support Person, if any, to review the alleged policy violations and the investigative report. The Respondent may choose to admit responsibility for all or part of the alleged policy violations at any point in the process. If the Respondent admits responsibility, in whole or in part, the decision -maker will render a finding that the individual is in violation of University policy for the admitted conduct. For any disputed violations, t he decision -maker will render a finding using the preponderance of the evidence standard. The decision -maker will also determine appropriate sanctions or remedial actions. The decision -maker will inform the Respondent and the Complainant simultaneously of the finding on each of the alleged policy violations and the finding of sanctions, if applicable, in writing by email to the Partys University -issued email account, or by the method of notification previously designated in writing by the Party.

The Pool Chair randomly selects and coordinates the hearing panel members to serve on the Hearing Panel for a specific Formal Complaint. The Pool Chair may serve as a panel member for a specific Formal Complaint. Administrators, faculty, and staff will be removed from the Hearing Panelist Pool if they fail to satisfy the annual training requirements, as determined by the Title IX Coordinator. Under such circumstances, the 70 Title IX Coordinator will notify the Chancellor (or Designee), who will inform the administrator, faculty, or staff member of the discontinuation of their term. Title IX Hearing Panel (Hearing Panel). When a Formal Complaint is not resolved through an Informal Resolution process, the Hearing Panelist Pool Chair will randomly select two (2) members from the Hearing Panelist Pool to serve on the specific Hearing Panel together with the Hearing Officer.

Good cause may include, but is not limited to, bias that would preclude an impartial hearing or circumstances in which the Hearing Panel members involvement could impact the Partys work or learning environment due to current or potential interactions with the Hearing Panel member (e.g., a panel member being in the same department as either Party). If the Title IX Coordinator determines that a Hearing Panel member, other than the Hearing Officer, should be unseated and replaced, then Title IX Coordinator will ask the Hearing Panel Pool Chair to randomly select another member from the pool to serve on the Hearing Panel. The Title IX Coordinator will select an alternate Hearing Officer if they determine that the Hearing Officer sh ould be replaced. The Title IX Coordinator will provide a written response to all Parties addressing any objections to the Hearing Panel members, including the Hearing Officer.

Record of Hearing. The Title IX Coordinator shall arrange for an audio or audiovisual recording of the hearing. The recording of the hearing will become part of the Record of the Case. Hearing Process Rules. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply to any live hearing. 73 Questions and evidence about the Complainants pre -disposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainants prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainants prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. Character evidence is information that does not directly relate to the facts at issue, but instead reflects upon the reputation, personality, or qualities of an individual, including honesty. Such evidence regarding either Partys character is of limited utility and shall not be admitted unless deemed relevant by the Hearing Officer. Incidents or behaviors of a Party not directly related to the possible violation(s) will not be considered unless they show a pattern of related misconduct. History of related misconduct by a Party that shows a pattern may be considered only if deemed rel evant by the Hearing Officer. A Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made or maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, may not be used without that Partys express consent. The Hearing Officer shall not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding such privilege has waived the priv ilege. The relevancy and admissibility of any evidence offered at the hearing shall be determined by the Hearing Officer, whose ruling shall be final. A Partys Advisor will be permitted to ask the other Party and any witnesses relevant questions and follow -up questions, including those challenging credibility. Before a Complainant, Respondent or witness answers a cross -examination or other question, th e Hearing Officer must first determine whether the question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant. Where the Hearing Officer permits a question to be answered, a presumption shall be made that the Hearing Officer deter mined that the question was relevant.

The Partys Advisors may object to questions on limited grounds as specified in the Rules of Decorum. The Hearing Officer will rule on such objections and that ruling shall be final. The Hearing Officer may dismiss any person from the hearing who interferes with or obstructs the hearing, fails to adhere to the Rules of Decorum, or fails to abide by the rulings of the Hearing Officer. Procedural questions which arise during the hearing and which are not covered by these general rules shall be determined by the Hearing Officer, whose ruling shall be final. Findings of the Hearing Panel. 74 The Hearing Panel will deliberate with no others present, except any legal advisor to the Hearing Panel, to find whether the Respondent is responsible or not responsible for the policy violation(s) in question. The Hearing Panel will base its finding on a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., whether it is more likely than not that the Respondent committed each alleged violation). If a Respondent is found responsible by a majority of the Hearing Panel, the Hearing Panel will determine appropriate sanctions and remedial actions by a majority vote. The Hearing Officer will prepare a written determination reflecting the decision of the Hearing Panel regarding responsibility, sanctions and remedial actions, if any (Hearing Panel Decision), and deliver it to the Title IX Coordinator detailing the following: (1) Identification of the allegations potentially constituting sexual harassment as defined in CRR 600.020; (2) A description of the procedural steps taken from the receipt of the Formal Complaint through the determination, including any notifications to t he Parties, interviews with Parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather other evidence and hearings held; (3) Findings of fact supporting the determination; (4) Conclusions regarding the application of the Universitys Title IX Policies to the facts; (5) A statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation, including a determination regarding responsibility, any disciplinary sanctions to be imposed on the Respondent, and whether remedies designed to restore or preserve equal ac cess to the Universitys education programs or activities will be provided by the University to the Complainant; and (6) The procedures and permissible bases for the Complainant and the Respondent to appeal.

The decision to reject the request for appeal is final and further appeals and grievances are not permitted. The Equity Resolution Appe llate Officer will render a written decision whether the request for appeal is accepted or rejected within fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the request for appeal. If no written decision is provided to the Parties within fifteen (15) business day s from receipt of the request, the appeal will be deemed accepted. Review of the Appeal. If all three (3) requirements for appeal listed in paragraph 4 above are met, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will accept the request for appeal and proceed with rendering a decision on the appeal applying the following additional principles: Appeals are not intended to be full re -hearings of the Formal Complaint and are therefore deferential to the original findings. In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation and Record of the Case, and relevant documentation regarding the grounds for appeal. Appeals granted based on new evidence should normally be remanded to the original decision -maker for reconsideration. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will render a written decision on the appeal to all Parties within ten (10) business days from accepting the request for appeal. In the event the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer is unable to render a written deci sion within ten (10) business days from accepting the 81 request for appeal, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will promptly notify the Parties in writing of the delay. Once an appeal is decided, the outcome is final. Further appeals are not permitted. Extensions of Time.

The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will notify the Parties in writing if such extensions are granted. Failure to Complete SanctionsComply with Interim and Long- term Remedial Actions. All Respondents are expected to comply with all sanctions and remedial actions within the timeframe specified. Failure to follow through on these sanctions and remedial actions by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect or any other reason, may res ult in additional sanctions and remedial actions andor suspension, expulsion, termination, referral to Dismissal for Cause process, or withdrawal of recognition from the University. Suspension will only be lifted when compliance is achieved to the satisfaction of the Title IX Coordinator. Dismissal for Cause Referral. If the recommended sanction for a Regular, Tenured Faculty member is referral to the Chancellor to initiate Dismissal for Cause, the Record of the Case will be forwarded to the appropriate Faculty Committee on Tenure. Because the Dismissal for Cause proceeding is not a re - hearing of the Complaint, the Record of the Case will be included as evidence and the findings will be adopted for proceeding as detailed in Section 310.060: Procedures in Case of Dismissal for Cause in the Collected Rules and Regulations. Records. In implementing this policy, records of all Formal Complaints, the Hearing Process or Academic Medical Center Process, and resolutions (including Informal resolution and result therefrom), will be kept by the Title IX Coordinator. For the purpose of review or appeal, the Record of the Case will be accessible at reasonable times and places to the Respondent and the Complainant. The Record of the Case will be kept for seven (7) years following final resolution. In addition, a record of the response to all complaints of sexual harassment, must be maintained for a period of seven (7) years, including records of any actions, including Supportive Measures, taken in response to a report or Formal Complaint of sexual h arassment. In each instance, the University must document the basis for its conclusion that its response was not deliberately indifferent, and document that it has taken measures designed to restore or preserve equal access to the Universitys education programs or activities. If the University did not provide a Complainant with Supportive Measures, the University must document the reasons why such a response was not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. Each Title IX Coordinator, including the Title IX Coordinator for the academic medical center, shall maintain statistical, de -identified data on the race, gender and age of each Party to a Formal Complaint for that university academic medical center, and will report such data on an annual basis to the President of the University of Missouri.

Retaliation. No person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this policy. Intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, including charges against an individual for policy violations that do not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or Formal Complaint of sexual harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured b y Title IX, constitutes retaliation. The University must keep confidential the identity of any individual who has made a report or complaint of sex discrimination, including any individual who has made a report or filed a Formal Complaint of sexual harassment, any Complainant, any individual who has been reported to be the perpetrator of sex discrimination, any Respondent, and any witness, except as may be permitted by the FERPA statute, 20 U.S.C. 1232g, or FERPA regulations, 34 CFR part 99, or as required by law, or to carry out the purposes of Title IX, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder. Complaints alleging retaliation may be filed with the Equity Officer in accordance with CRRs 600.010, 600.040, and 600.050. The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute retaliation prohibited under this section. Charging an individual with a policy violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of the any proceedings under this policy does not constitute retaliation provided, however that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any Party made a materially false statement in bad faith. 600.040 Equity Resolution Process for Resolving Complaints of Discrimination and Harassment against a Faculty Member or Student or Student Organization - for matters involving conduct alleged to have occurred on or after August 14, 2020 Bd.

In all cases in which an Emergency Removal is imposed, the Respondent will immediately be given notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision of the Equity Officer either prior to such Removal being imposed, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible but no later than five (5) business days following the Removal. Any challenge by Respondent shall be made in writing and directed to the Equity Officer and must show cause why the Removal should n ot be implemented.

Each Complainant and Respondent is allowed to have one Equity Support Person of their choice present with them for all Equity Resolution Process interviews, meetings and proceedings. The Parties may select whomever they wish to serve as their Equity Suppor t Person, including an attorney or parent. If requested by a Student Party, the Equity Officer may assign an Equity Support Person to explain the Equity Resolution process and attend interviews, meetings and proceedings with a Student Party. University Equity Support Person(s) are administrators, faculty, or staff at the University trained on the Equity Resolution Process. The Parties may not require that the assigned Equity Support Person have specific qualifications such as being an attorney. An Equity Support Person cannot be called upon as a witness by a Party in a hearing to testify about matters learned while that individual was acting in their capacity as an Equity Support Person. The Equity Support Person may not make a presentation or represent the Complainant or Respondent during the hearing. At the hearing, the Parties are expected to ask and respond to questions on their own behalf, without representation by the Equity Support Person. The Equity Support Person may consult with the Party quietly or in writing, or outside the hearing during breaks, but may not speak on behalf of the Party to the hearing panelists.

If the Equity Support Person fails to follow these guidelines, they will be warned or dismissed from the hearing at the discretion of the Hearing Panel Chair. Investigation. Upon the initiation of a formal investigation, the Equity Officer will promptly appoint a trained Investigator or a team of trained Investigators to investigate the Complaint. 92 The burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rests on the University. The University cannot access, consider, disclose, or otherwise use a Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, unless the University obtains that Partys voluntary, written consent to do so for use in the Equity Resolution process. The Parties are not prohibited from discussing the allegations under investigation or from gathering and presenting relevant evidence. The Parties may present witnesses and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence; all such evidence must be relevant. A Party whose participation is expected or invited at a hearing, interview, or other meeting, shall receive written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of all hearings, investigative interviews, or other meetings, with sufficient time for the Party to prepare to participate. The Parties may be accompanied to any related meeting or interview by an Equity Support Person of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney; however, the Equity Support Person may only participate in the proceedings as set forth in this policy. The Investigator(s) will make reasonable efforts to conduct interviews with the Parties and relevant witnesses, obtain available evidence and identify sources of expert information, if necessary. The Investigator(s) will provide an investigative report to the Equity Officer. This report may contain the Investigators observations regarding the credibility of the Complainant, the Respondent, and any witnesses interviewed. The final investigative report will fairly summarize the relevant evidence. All investigations will be thorough, reliable and impartial. All interviews shall be recorded. In the event that recording is not possible due to technological issues, the investigator shall take thorough notes and such notes shall be provided to the Part ies in lieu of recordings. The investigator shall document the reason the recording was not possible and such documentation shall become part of the Record of the Case.

Investigation of a Complaint may take longer based on the nature and circumstances of th e Complaint. Impact of Optional Report to Law Enforcement. A delay may also occur when criminal charges on the basis of the same behaviors that invoke this process are being investigated, to allow for evidence collection by the law enforcement agency. However, University action will not typically be altered or precluded on the grounds that civil cases or criminal charges involving the same incident have been filed or that such charges have been dismissed or reduced. The Equity Officer will not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal proceeding to begin the Equity Resolution process. However, an Equity investigation and resolution process may be temporarily delayed for good cause, which can include concurrent law enforcement activity. In such instances, written notice of the delay or extension with reasons for the action will be sent to each Party. 93 If delayed, the Equity Officer will promptly resume the Equity investigation as soon as notified by the law enforcement agency that it has completed the evidence- gathering process. The Equity Officer will implement appropriate supportive measures during the law enforcement agencys investigation period to provide for the safety of all Parties, the University community and the avoidance of retaliation, discrimination, or harassment. Summary Resolution. During or upon completion of investigation, the Equity Officer will review the investigation which may include meeting with the Investigator(s). The investigative report is not provided to the Parties during Summary Resolution, but is provided to the Par ties at either the Administrative Resolution or Hearing Panel Resolution. Based on that review, the Equity Officer will make a summary determination whether, based on the evidence gathered, there is a sufficient basis to proceed with th e Complaint that the Respondent is responsible for violating the Universitys Anti - Discrimination Policies. If the Equity Officer determines that there is a sufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, then the Equity Officer will direct the process to continue. The Complaint will then be resolved through either Conflict Resolution, Administrative Resolution, or Hearing Panel Resolution. There is no right to request reconsideration or appeal the summary determination to continue the process. If the Equity Officer determines that there is an insufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, then the process will end and the Complainant and Respondent will simultaneously be sent written notification of the determination and advised of their righ t to request reconsideration. The Equity Officer may counsel and suggest monitoring or training opportunities to correct for inappropriate behavior that does not rise to the level of a violation. The Parties may request that the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer reconsider summary determination ending the process by filing a written request with the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer within five (5) business days of notice", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 83, "word_count": 500}

This decision to end the process lies in the sole discretion of the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer and such decision is final. Further reconsideration of such decision is not permitted. Conflict Resolution. The Parties may choose to engage in Conflict Resolution at any time during the Equity Resolution Process. The decision of the Parties to engage in Conflict Resolution must be voluntary, informed, and in writing. The Parties are not required to engage in Conflict Resolution as a condition of enrollment or continuing enrollment, or employment or continuing employment, or enjoyment of any other right. The Parties are not required to waive their right to an investigation of a Complaint or a right to a hearing. It is not necessary to pursue Conflict Resolution prior to pursuing the Administrative or Hearing Panel Resolution Process and either Party can stop the Conflict Resolution 94 Process at any time and request either the Administrative Resolution Process or Hearing Panel Resolution Process. Conflict Resolution is never available to resolve allegations that an employee sexually harassed or engaged in sexual misconduct with a stude nt. Upon receiving a request for Conflict Resolution, the Equity Officer will determine if Conflict Resolution is appropriate based on the willingness of the Parties, the nature of the conduct at issue and the susceptibility of the conduct to Conflict Res olution. In Conflict Resolution, which includes mediation or facilitated dialogue, a neutral facilitator will foster dialogue with the Parties to an effective resolution, if possible. The Complainants and the Respondents Equity Support Person may attend the Confl ict Resolution meeting. The Parties will abide by the terms of the agreed upon resolution.

In the event the Parties are unable to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, the matter will be referred back to the Administrative or Hearing Panel Resolution process. The content of the Parties discussion during the Conflict Resolution Process will be kept confidential in the event the matter proceeds to the Administrative or Hearing Panel Resolution processes. The Parties agreement to participate in, refusal to participate in, or termination of participation in Conflict Resolution shall not be factors in any subsequent decisions regarding whether a policy violation occurred. Among the resolutions which may be reached at this stage (or at any point prior to a finding through Administrative or Hearing Panel Resolution), the Respondent may voluntarily request to permanently separate from the University of Missouri System. If the Equity Officer accepts the Respondents proposal, the Respondent must sign a Voluntary Permanent Separation and General Release agreement to effectuate their separation and terminate the Equity Resolution process. Procedural Details for Administrative Resolution and Hearing Panel Resolution. For both the Administrative Resolution and Hearing Panel Resolution, which are described in more detail below, the following will apply: The standard of proof will be preponderance of the evidence, defined as determining whether evidence shows it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred. The Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the Equity Resolution process. The decision -maker has the discretion to determine the relevance of any witness or documentary evidence and may exclude information that is irrelevant, immaterial, cumulative, or more prejudicial than informative. In addition, the following rules shall ap ply to the introduction of evidence: Questions and evidence about the Complainants pre -disposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainants prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainants prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. 95 Character evidence is information that does not directly relate to the facts at issue, but instead reflects upon the reputation, personality, or qualities of an individual, including honesty. Such evidence regarding either Partys character is of limited utility and shall not be admitted unless deemed relevant by the decision -maker. Incidents or behaviors of a Party not directly related to the possible violation(s) will not be considered unless they show a pattern of related misconduct.

A Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made or maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, may not be used without that Partys express consent. The decision -maker shall not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding such privilege has waived the privi lege. The Respondent may not directly question the Complainant and the Complainant may not directly question the Respondent. However, if both Complainant and Respondent request the opportunity, direct questioning between the Parties will be permitted in the Hearing Panel Resolution Process. Otherwise written questions will be directed to the Chair in the Hearing Panel Resolution Process, and those questions deemed appropriate and relevant will be asked on behalf of the requesting Party. In the Administrative Resolution Process, the Respondent and the Complainant may provide a list of questions for the decision -maker to ask the other Party. If those questions are deemed appropriate and relevant, they may be asked on behalf of the requestin g Party; answers to such questions will be shared with the requesting Party. At any time prior to the deadline in the Notice of Administrative Resolution, the Complainant andor the Respondent may request that the Complaint shift from the Administrative Resolution process to the Hearing Panel Resolution process. Upon receipt of such timely request from either Party, the Complaint will shift to the Hearing Panel Resolution Process. The Resolution Processes may proceed regardless of whether the Respondent chooses to participate in the investigation, the finding or the hearing. The Administrative Resolution or Hearing Panel Resolution Process will normally be completed within a reasonably prompt time period, not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days, following the Equity Officers receipt of a Complaint. Unusual delays will be promptly communicated to both Parties. For good cause, the decision -maker may, in their discretion, grant reasonable extensions to the time frames and limits provided. Administrative Resolution: 96 Administrative Resolution can be pursued for any behavior that falls within the Universitys Anti- Discrimination Policies. Administrative Resolution may be used when both Parties elect to resolve the Complaint using the Administrative Resolution Process. The Administrative Resolution process consists of: A prompt, thorough and impartial investigation; A separate meeting with each Party and their Equity Support Person, if any, and the decision -maker, if requested; A written finding by the decision -maker on each of the alleged policy violations: (1) For Faculty Respondents by the Provost", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 86, "word_count": 500}

Appeal. Both Complainant and Respondent are allowed to appeal a determination regarding responsibility in the Administrative Resolution Process or the finding(s) in the Hearing Panel Resolution Process. Grounds for appeal.

Requests for Appeal. Both the Complainant and the Respondent may appeal to the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer must not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or an individual Complainant or Respondent; if the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer does not believe that they can make an objective decision about an appeal, they should recuse themselves. For Student and Student Organization Respondents, the Chancellor (or Designee) shall appoint an alternate Equity Resolution Appellate Officer to hear the pending appeal; For Faculty Respondents, the President (or Designee) shall appoint an alternate Equity Resolution Appellate Officer to hear the pending appeal. All requests for appeal must be submitted in writing to the Equity Resolution Appellate Of ficer within five (5) business days of the delivery of the Notice of Administrative Resolution or Hearing Panel Decision.

The response can address that sufficient grounds for appeal have not been met andor the merits of the appeal. Review of the Request to Appeal. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will make an initial review of the appeal request(s). The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will review the request for appeal to determine whether: The request is timely; The appeal is on the basis of any of the articulated grounds listed above; and When viewed in the light most favorable to the appealing Party, the appeal states grounds that could result in an adjusted finding or sanction. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will reject the request for appeal if any of the above requirements are not met. The decision to reject the request for appeal is final and further appeals and grievances are not permitted. The Equity Resolution Appe llate Officer will render a written decision whether the request for appeal is accepted or rejected within fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the request for appeal. If no written decision is provided to the Parties within fifteen (15) business day s from receipt of the request, the appeal will be deemed accepted. Review of the Appeal. If all three requirements for appeal listed in Paragraph 4 above are met, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will accept the request for appeal and proceed with rendering a decision on the appeal applying the following additional principles: Appeals are not intended to be full re -hearings of the Complaint and are therefore deferential to the original findings. In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation and Record of the Case, Administrative Resolution determin ation, or Hearing Panel Resolution, and relevant documentation regarding the grounds for appeal. Appeals granted based on new evidence should normally be remanded to the original decision- maker for reconsideration. 106 The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will normally render a written decision on the appeal to all Parties within ten (10) business days from accepting the request for appeal. In the event the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer is unable to render a written decision within ten (10) business days from accepting the request for appeal, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will promptly notify the Parties in writing of the delay. Once an appeal is decided, the outcome is final. Further appeals and grievances are not permitted. Extensions of Time. For good cause, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer may grant reasonable extensions of time (e.g.: 7 -10 business days) to the deadlines in the appeal process. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will notify the Parties in writing if such extensions are granted. Failure to Complete SanctionsComply with Interim and Long- term Remedial Actions.

In implementing this policy, records of all Complaints, resolutions (including Conflict resolution and result therefrom, and Administrative Resolution and result therefrom), and hearings will be kept by the Equity Officer. For the purpose of review or appeal, the Record of the Case will be accessible at reasonable times and places to the Respondent and the Complainant. The Record of the Case will be kept for seven (7) years following final resolution. Each Equity Officer, including the Equity Officer for the academic medical center, shall maintain statistical, de -identified data on the race, gender and age of each Party to a Complaint for that university academic medical center, and will report such data on an annual basis to the President of the University of Missouri. Additionally, statistical data relating to each university in the University of Missouri System shall be reported on an annual basis to that universitys Chancellor and chief officers for human resources, student affairs, and diversity, equity and inclusion; the academic medical center shall report such statistical data for the academic medical center on an annual basis to the Executive Vice -Chancellor for Health Affairs.

Because the Dismissal for Cause proceeding is not a re - hearing of the Complaint, the Record of the Case will be included as evidence and the findings will be adopted for proceeding as detailed in Section 310.060: Procedures in Case of Dismissal for Cause in the Collected Rules and Regulations. Retaliation. The University strictly prohibits retaliation against any person for making any good faith report of discrimination or harassment, or for filing, testifying, assisting, or participating in any investigation or proceeding involving allegations of discrimination or harassment. For matters involving discrimination or harassment other than sex discrimination under this policy, employees have an 107 obligation to cooperate with University officials including the Investigator, Equity Officer, Provost (or Designee), Hearing Panel, andor the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer. For matters involving sex discrimination under this policy, no person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law, or because the individual has made a r eport or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding,", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 98, "word_count": 500}

Intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, including charges against an individual for policy violations that do not involve sex discrimination or sexual harassment, but arise out of the same facts or circumstances as a report or complaint of sex discrimination, or a report or Complaint of sexual harassment, for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by law, constitutes retaliation. The University must keep confidential the identity of any individual who has made a report or complaint of sex discrimination, including any individual who has made a report or filed a Complaint of sexual harassment, any Complainant, any individual who has been reported to be the perpetrator of sex discrimination, any Respondent, and any witness, except as may be permitted by the FERPA statute, 20 U.S.C. 1232g, or FERPA regulations, 34 CFR part 99, or as required by law, or to carry out the purposes of appl icable law, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder. Complaints alleging retaliation may be filed with the Equity Officer in accordance with CRRs 600.010, 600.040, and 600.050. Any person who engages in such retaliation shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion or termination, in accordance with applicable procedures. Any person who believes they have been subjected to retaliation is encouraged to notify the Equity Officer. The University will promptly investigate all complaints of retaliation in accordance with this policy. The exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment does not constitute retaliation prohibited under this section. Charging an individual with a policy violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of any proceedings under this policy does not constitute retaliation provided, however that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any Party made a materially false statement in bad faith. 600.050 Equity Resolution Process for Resolving Complaints of Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct against a Staff Member or the University of Missouri - for matters involving conduct alleged to have occurred on or after August 14, 2020 Bd.

If the identity of the Complainant is unknown, the Equity Officer may conduct a li mited investigation sufficient to identify to Complainant to the extent possible. In addition to making preliminary contact, the Equity Officer shall conduct a preliminary inquiry to gather enough information to make a threshold decision regarding whether the report describes a possible violation of the Universitys anti- discrimination policies. If the report describes a possible violation, the Equity Officer will refer the matter to the appropriate procedural process and provide appropriate supportive measures. If the report does not describe a possible violation, the matter will be referred to the appropriate non -Equity process. Under those circumstances, the Equity Officer may counsel and suggest monitoring or training opportunities to correct for inappropriate behavior that does not rise to the level of a violation. The preliminary inquiry shall be conducted promptly (typically within 7 -10 business days) of receiving the report. Filing a Complaint . A Complaint is a document prepared by the Equity Officer after a verbal or written report of alleged discrimination or harassment becomes known to the University, or a document filed and signed by a Complainant alleging discrimination or harassment again st a Respondent and requesting that the University investigate the allegation. As used herein, the phrase document filed and signed by a complainant means a document or electronic submission (such as by electronic mail or through an 112 online portal provided for this purpose by the University) that contains the complainants physical or digital signature, or otherwise indicates that the Complainant is the person filing the Complaint. All Complaints alleging discrimination or harassment under this policy will be investigated. The University may serve as the Complainant when the person alleged to have been subjected to discrimination or harassment in violation of the Universitys Anti-D iscrimination policies chooses not to act as the Complainant in the resolution process or requests that the Complaint not be pursued. If the University decides to pursue a report of discrimination by a visitor, third party or applicant through the applicable equity resolution process, the University will act as the Complainant. Where the Equity Officer prepares a Complaint, the Equity Officer is not a Complainant or otherwise a party under this policy. The University may consolidate Complaints as to allegations of discrimination or harassment against more than one Respondent, or by more than one Complainant against one or more Respondents, or by one party against the other Party where the allegations of discrimination or harassment, arise of the same facts or circumstances. Where this process involves more than one Complainant or more than one Respondent, each Complainant and each Respondent shall be entitled and subject to all of the rights and obligations set forth herein.", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 104, "word_count": 500}

Notice also may be provided in person to either Party. Notice is presumptively deemed delivered, when: 1) provided in person, 2) emailed to the individual, or 3) when mailed. Supportive Measures and Administrative Leave Supportive Measures. Supportive measures are non -disciplinary, non -punitive individualized services offered as appropriate, as reasonably available, and without fee or charge to the Complainant or the Respondent before or after the filing of a Complaint. These measures are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the Universitys education programs, activities or employment without unreasonably burdening the other Party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all Parties or the Universitys education environment, or deter discrimination and harassment. The University will maintain as confidential any supportive measures provided to the Complainant or Respondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of the University to provide the supportive measures. The Equity Officer is responsible for the effective implementation of supportive measures. Supportive measures may include: Referral and facilitating contact for the Complainant or Respondent for counseling or other support services. Mutual restrictions on contact between the Parties. Providing campus escort services to the Parties. Increased security and monitoring of certain areas of the campus. Adjusting the extracurricular activities, work schedules, work assignments, supervisory responsibilities, or work arrangements of the Complainant andor Respondent, as appropriate.

False statements, fraudulent evidence or refusal to cooperate with the Investigato r, the Equity HR Officer (or Designee), the Equity Officer, andor the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer by an employee may be the basis for personnel action pursuant to CRR 370.010 or HR 601, or other applicable University policies, or if by a student may be the basis for disciplinary action pursuant to CRR 200.010. However, this obligation does not supersede nor expand any rights the individual may have under applicable state or federal statutory law or the U.S. Constitution. For purposes of this policy , refusal to cooperate does not include refusal to participate in any proceedings involving sex discrimination. The fact that a determination has been made that a Respondent has or has not violated any policy is not sufficient grounds, by itself, to dec lare that a false statement or fraudulent evidence has been provided by a Party or witness. No employee or student, directly or through others, should take any action which may interfere with the investigation. Employees and students are prohibited from attempted or actual intimidation or harassment of any potential witness. Failure to adhere to these requirements may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion or termination. Rights of the Parties in the Equity Resolution Process . To be treated with respect by University officials. To be free from retaliation. To have access to University support resources (such as counseling and mental health services and University health services). To request a no contact directive between the Parties. To have an Equity Support Person of the Partys choice accompany the Party to all interviews, meetings, and proceedings throughout the Equity Resolution Process. To refuse to have an allegation resolved through Conflict Resolution Process. 115 To receive prior to Administrative Resolution, an investigative report that fairly summarizes the relevant evidence in an electronic format or hard copy for their review and written response. To have an opportunity to present a list of potential witnesses and provide evidence to the Investigator. To have Complaints heard in substantial accordance with these procedures.

Additional Rights for Students as a Party: To request reasonable housing, living and other accommodations and remedies consistent with Section 600.050.I. To receive amnesty for minor student misconduct that is ancillary to the incident, at the discretion of the Equity Officer. Role of Equity Support Persons. Each Complainant and Respondent is allowed to have one Equity Support Person of their choice present with them for all Equity Resolution Process interviews, meetings and proceedings. The Parties may select whomever they wish to serve as their Equity Suppo rt Person, including an attorney. An Equity Support Person is not required and any Party may elect to proceed without an Equity Support Person. If Complainant is a student, they may request that the Equity Officer assign an Equity Support Person to provide support throughout the Equity Resolution Process. University Equity Support Person(s) are administrators, faculty, or staff at the University t rained on the Equity Resolution Process. The Complainant may not require that the assigned Equity Support Person have specific qualifications such as being an attorney. An Equity Support Person cannot be called upon as a witness by a Party in a hearing to testify about matters learned while that individual was acting in their capacity as an Equity Support Person. Investigation. Upon the initiation of a formal investigation, the Equity Officer will promptly appoint a trained Investigator or a team of trained Investigators to investigate the Complaint. The burden of proof and the burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility rests on the University. The University cannot access, consider, disclose, or otherwise use a Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or paraprofessionals capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and 116 maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, unless the University obtains that Partys voluntary, written consent to do so for use in the Equity Resolution process. The Parties are not prohibited from discussing the allegations under investigation or from gathering and presenting relevant evidence. The Parties may present witnesses and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence; all such evidence must be relevant. A Party whose participation is expected or invited at an interview or meeting shall receive written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of all meetings or investigative interviews with sufficient time for the Party to prepare to p articipate. The Parties may be accompanied to any related meeting or proceeding by an Equity Support Person of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney; however, the Equity Support Person may only participate in the proceedings as set forth in this policy.

The Investigator(s) will make reasonable efforts to conduct interviews with the Parties and relevant witnesses, obtain available evidence and identify sources of expert information, if necessary. The Investigator(s) will provide an investigative report to the Equity Officer. This report may contain the Investigators observations regarding the credibility of the Complainant, the Respondent, and any witnesses interviewed. The final investigative report will fairly summarize the relevant evidence. All investigations will be thorough, reliable and impartial. All interviews shall be recorded. In the event that recording is not possible due to technological issues, the investigator shall take thorough notes and such notes shall be provided to the Part ies in lieu of recordings. The investigator shall document the reason the recording was not possible and such documentation shall become part of the Record of the Case. The investigation of reported discrimination or harassment should be completed expeditiously, normally within thirty (30) business days of the filing of the Complaint. Investigation of a Complaint may take longer based on the nature and circumstances of th e Complaint. Impact of Optional Report to Law Enforcement . A delay may also occur when criminal charges on the basis of the same behaviors that invoke this process are being investigated, to allow for evidence collection by the law enforcement agency. However, University action will not typically be altered or precluded on the grounds that civil cases or criminal charges involving the same incident have been filed or that such charges have been dismissed or reduced. The Equity Officer will not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal proceeding to begin the Equity Resolution process. However, an Equity investigation and resolution process may be temporarily delayed for good cause, which can include concurrent law enforcement activity. In such instances, written notice of the delay or extension with reasons for the action will be sent to each Party. If delayed, the Equity Officer will promptly resume the Equity investigation as soon as notified by the law enforcement agency that it has completed the evidence- gathering process. The Equity Officer will implement appropriate supportive measures during the law enforcement agencys investigation period to provide for the safety of all Parties, the University community and the avoidance of retaliation, discrimination, or harassment. 117 Summary Resolution . During or upon completion of investigation, the Equity Officer will review the investigation which may include meeting with the Investigator(s). The investigative report is not provided to the Parties during Summary Resolution, but is provided to the P arties at Administrative Resolution. Based on that review, the Equity Officer will make a summary determination whether, based on the evidence gathered, there is a sufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint that the Respondent is res ponsible for violating the Universitys Anti- Discrimination Policies.

If the Equity Officer determines that there is a sufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, then the Equity Officer will direct the process to continue. The Complaint will then be resolved through either Conflict Resolution or Administrative Resolutio n. There is no right to request reconsideration or appeal the summary determination to continue the process. If the Equity Officer determines that there is an insufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, then the process will end and the Complainant and Respondent will simultaneously be sent written notification of the determination and advised of their righ t to request reconsideration. The Equity Officer may counsel and suggest monitoring or training opportunities to correct for inappropriate behavior that does not rise to the level of a violation. The Parties may request that the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer reconsider summary determination ending the process by filing a written request with the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer within five (5) business days of notice of the summary determi nation. If the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer decides there is a sufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will reverse the determination ending the process and direct the process to continue pursuant to t his policy. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will simultaneously send the Parties notice of their decision. This decision to continue the process lies in the sole discretion of the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer and such decision is final. Further reconsideration of such decision is not permitted. If the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer agrees with the summary determination ending the process by the Equity Officer that there is not a sufficient basis to proceed with the Complaint, then the process will end and the Complainant and the Respondent w ill simultaneously be sent written notification of the decision. This decision to end the process lies in the sole discretion of the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer and such decision is final. Further reconsideration of such decision is not permitted . Conflict Resolution . The Parties may choose to engage in Conflict Resolution at any time during the Equity Resolution Process. The decision of the Parties to engage in Conflict Resolution must be voluntary, informed, and in writing. The Parties are not required to engage in Conflict Resolution as a condition of enrollment or continuing enrollment, or employment or continuing employment, or enjoyment of any other right. The Parties are not required to waive their right to an investigation of a Complaint or a right to Administrative Resolution. It is not necessary to pursue Conflict Resolution prior to pursuing the Administrative Resolution Process and either Party can stop the Conflict Resolution Process at any time and request the Administrative Resoluti on Process.

Conflict Resolution is never available to resolve allegations that an employee sexually harassed or engaged in sexual misconduct with a student. Upon receiving a request for Conflict Resolution, the Equity Officer will determine if Conflict Re solution is appropriate based on the willingness of the Parties, the nature of the conduct at issue and the susceptibility of the conduct to Conflict Resolution. 118 In Conflict Resolution, which includes mediation or facilitated dialogue, a neutral facilitator will foster dialogue with the Parties to an effective resolution, if possible. The Complainants and the Respondents Equity Support Person may attend the Confl ict Resolution meeting. The Parties will abide by the terms of the agreed upon resolution. Failure to abide by the terms of the agreed upon resolution may be referred to the Equity Officer for review and referral to the appropriate University Process for discipline or sanctions. The Equity Officer will keep records of any Conflict Resolution that is reached. In the event the Parties are unable to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, the matter will be referred back to the Administrative Resolution process. The content of the Parties discussion during the Conflict Resolution Process will be kept confidential in the event the matter proceeds to the Administrative Resolution Process. The Parties agreement to participate in, refusal to participate in, or termination of participation in Conflict Resolution shall not be factors in any subsequent decisions regarding whether a policy violation occurred. Administrative Resolution. Procedural Details for Administrative Resolution . The Administrative Resolution process is a process whereby decision -makers will meet with the Parties and their Equity Support Person, if any, and consider the evidence provided by the investigator, including the investigative report, and evidence provid ed by the Parties, and will make a determination of responsibility that is binding on both Parties. For the Administrative Resolution Process, which is described in more detail below, the following will appl y: The standard of proof will be preponderance of the evidence, defined as determining whether evidence shows it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred. The decision -makers have the discretion to determine the relevance of any witness or documentary evidence and may exclude information that is irrelevant, immaterial, cumulative, or more prejudicial than informative. In addition, the following rules shall apply to the introduction of evidence: (1) Questions and evidence about the Complainants pre -disposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainants prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent commi tted conduct alleged by the Complainant, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainants prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. (2) Character", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 111, "word_count": 500}

(2) Character evidence is information that does not directly relate to the facts at issue, but instead reflects upon the reputation, personality, or qualities of an individual, including honesty. Such evidence regarding either Partys character is of limited utility and shall not be admitted unless deemed relevant by the decision -makers. (3) Incidents or behaviors of a Party not directly related to the possible violation(s) will not be considered unless they show a pattern of related misconduct. History of related misconduct by a Party that shows a patt ern may be considered only if deemed relevant by the decision -makers. (4) A Partys records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professionals or parapro fessionals capacity, 119 or assisting in that capacity, and which are made or maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, may not be used without that Partys express consent. (5) The decision -makers shall not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless the person holding such privilege has waived the privilege. In the Administrative Resolution Process, the Respondent and the Complainant may provide a list of questions for the decision -makers to ask the other Party. If those questions are deemed appropriate and relevant, they may be asked on behalf of the requesti ng Party; answers to such questions will be shared with the requesting Party. The Administrative Resolution Process may proceed regardless of whether the Respondent chooses to participate in the investigation or the finding. The Administrative Resolution Process will normally be completed within a reasonably prompt time period, not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days, following the Equity Officers receipt of a Complaint. Unusual delays will be promptly communicated to bo th Parties. For good cause, the Equity Officer (for University Respondents), or Equity HR Officer (for Staff Respondents) may, in their discretion, grant reasonable extensions to the timeframes and limits provided. Process for Administrative Resolution Administrative Resolution can be pursued for any behavior that falls within the Universitys Anti-Discrimination Policies. The Administrative Resolution process consists of: A prompt, thorough and impartial investigation by the Investigator; A separate meeting with each Party and their Equity Support Person, if any, and the joint decision - makers, if requested; A joint finding by designated decision -makers. For Complaints against a Staff member as a Respondent, a joint finding will be issued by the Equity HR Officer and Supervisor on each of the alleged policy violations and sanctions and remedial actions, if any, for findings of responsibility.

Requests for Appeal. Both the Complainant and the Respondent may appeal to the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer must not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainants or Respondents generally or an individual Comp lainant or Respondent; if the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer does not believe that they can make an objective decision about an appeal, they should recuse themselves and the Chancellor (or Designee) for University Staff Respondents , or the President (or Designee) for System Staff and University Respondents, shall appoint an alternate Equity Resolution Appellate Officer to hear the pending appeal.

Review of the Request to Appeal. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will make an initial review of the appeal request(s) to determine whether: The request is timely; The appeal is on the basis of any of the articulated grounds listed above; and When viewed in the light most favorable to the appealing Party, the appeal states grounds that could result in an adjusted finding or sanction. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will reject the request for appeal if any of the above requirements are not met. The decision to reject the request for appeal is final and further appeals and grievances are not permitted. The Equity Resolution Appe llate Officer will render a written decision whether the request for appeal is accepted or rejected within fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the request for appeal. If no written decision is provided to the Parties within fifteen (15) business day s from receipt of the request, the appeal will be deemed accepted. Review of the Appeal. If all three requirements for appeal listed in Paragraph 4 above are met, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will accept the request for appeal and proceed with rendering a decision on the appeal applying the following additional principles: Appeals are not intended to be full re -hearings of the Complaint and are therefore deferential to the original findings. In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation and Record of the Case, and pertinent documentation regarding the grounds for appeal. Appeals granted based on new evidence should normally be remanded to the original decision -maker for reconsideration. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will provide a written decision on the appeal simultaneously to all Parties within ten (10) business days from accepting the request for appeal. This decision will describe the result of the appeal and the rationale for the result. In the event the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer is unable to render a written decision within ten (10) business days from accepting the request for appeal, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will promptly notify the Parties in writing of the dela y. Once an appeal is decided, the outcome is final. Further appeals and grievances are not permitted. Extensions of Time . For good cause, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer may grant reasonable extensions of time (e.g.: 7 -10 business days) to the deadlines in the appeal process.

TAKE A SCREENING 134 Annual Disclosure of Crime Statistics Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (20 USC 1092(f)) requires colleges and universities across the United States to disclose information about crime on and around their campuses. The University Police maintains a close relationship with all police departments where MU owns or control property. This ensures that crimes reported directly to these police departments that involve the University are brought to the attention of the Univ ersity Police. The University Police collects the crime statistics dis closed in the charts through several methods. Police communications and officers enter all reports of crime incidents made directly to the department through an integrated computer aided -dispatch records management system. After an officer enters the report in the system, a depart ment administrator reviews the report to ensure it is appropriately classified in the correct crime category. The Department periodically examines the data to ensure tha t all reported crimes are recorded in accord ance with the crime definitions outlined in the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook and the FBI National Incident -Based Reporting System Handbook (sex offenses only). In addition to the crime data that the Universi ty Police maintains, the statistics below also include crimes that are reported to various campus security authorities, as defined in this report. The statistics reported here generally reflect the number of criminal incidents reported to the various autho rities. The statistics reported for the subcategories on liquor laws, drug laws and weapons offenses represented the number of people arrested or referred to campus judicial authorities for respective violations, not the number of offenses documented.

The following report details all information required by this act for MU. Definitions On-Campus Student Housing A student housing facility that is owned or controlled by the institution or is located on property that is owned or controlled by the institution and is within a reasonable contiguous area that makes up the campus. Fire Any instance of open flame or other burning in a place not intended to contain the burning or in an uncontrolled manner. Fire Safety The University of Missouri has adopted numerous policies to promote a safe living and working environment at all University locations. The full text of these policies as well as other important fire safety information can be found under Residential Life Policies and Procedures. 187 Electrical Appliances Residents use or possession of appliances is restricted by the type, size and number permitted. Due to the high electrical demand of many appliances, Residential Life recommends residents limit the number of appliances used simultaneously to avoid causing a breaker to flip resulting in loss of power to the appliances. Roommates and suitemates should discuss appliances and who will bring what to avoid duplication, as only one microwave and refrigerator is allowed per room. All residents must abide by the following restrictions on electrical appliances in the residence halls and undergraduate apartments: No space heaters of any kind are permitted. One compact refrigerator that is 4.5 cubic feet or smaller is allowed in each bedroom (residence halls only). One microwave under 1000 watts is allowed in each bedroom (residence halls only). Cooking appliances allowed in student rooms include but not limited to: coffee makers, rice steamers, popcorn air poppers, crock pots, and slow cookers. Cooking appliances not allowed include but are not limited to: toasters, toaster ovens, electric grills (such as George Foreman grills), panini presses, pressure cookers (such as an InstantPot). All appliances with exposed heating elements and external oil or grease collection are prohibited. All appliances must be UL -Approved. Residential Life also requires the use of surge protector strips with a 15 -amp circuit breaker and safety reset switch. A surge protector strip should only be plugged directly into the wall not into an outlet multiplier or into another surge protector strip (no daisy -chaining). Overloading outlets and overusemisuse of equipment is prohibited. Total electrical usage should not exceed that which can be provided by one surge protector strip per outlet and should not overload, short or create line disturbances. Smoke -free Residence Areas In recognition of the health, safety and comfort benefits of smoke -free air and the responsibility to provide and maintain an optimally healthy and safe working and living environment for faculty, students, staff and visitors, the University of Missouri is smoke -free as of July 1, 2013. No smoking is permitted on any university property, in any university -owned buildings or in university - leased buildings or vehicles, including Residential Life Housing.

No smoking is permitted on any university property, in any university -owned buildings or in university - leased buildings or vehicles, including Residential Life Housing. Use of products including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, e -cigarettes, hookahs, pipes and water pipes are prohibited. Safe storage of such products is permitted, provided the product is not used on university -owned or - operated property. Open flame and flammable materials Candles (with or without wicks), incense, oil lamps, oilwax diffusers that sit on lightbulbs or other items with the capability of an open flame or burning ember are not permitted in any residence hall and are subject to confiscation and forfeiture. Resid ents are allowed to use UL -approved electric or battery - operated candle products. Examples include, but are not limited to, Scentsy and Scentbug products and battery -operated pillar candles. Incense oils must be enclosed. Reed diffusers in open bottles are not allowed because they ruin furniture and leave a permanent scent. The use, possession, display or ignition of fireworks or any type of explosive device is prohibited on university property. 188 Tampering with or theft of fire safety equipment, including tampering with or discharging fire extinguishers, disabling bellshorns, activating a fire alarm when no emergency exists or covering or removing the batteries from individual smoke detectors, removing the entire smoke detector apparatus, or tampering with, hanging objects from, or decorating sprinkler heads in rooms of halls that are thus equipped are prohibited. Residence Hall Fire Drills In 2023 fire drills were conducted twice in each residence hall, including Manor House and Tara Apartments. The 202 3 Fire Amenities graph indicates each Residence Hall by name and the number of fire drills. Fire drills provide residents the opportunity to become familiar with the notification system as well as the evacuation procedures. During the drill and any other time that the fire alarm sounds residents should calmly evacuate the building and follow the instructions of staff and emergency personnel. Fa ilure to vacate or in any other way interfere with the emergency response process will be considered a violation of Residential Life policy and handled accordingly. Students who require any type of accommodation to ensure their safe evacuation should contact the Residence Hall Coordinator or the Apartment Manager at University Student Apartments immediately upon moving into the facility so that the appropriate arrange ments can be made.

The initiation of the alarm notifies residents audibly and visually. Except for Tara Apartments any initiation of the fire alarm notifies an off -site response center that dispatches emergency responders to the location. One hundred percent (100) of the Residential Life owned residence halls and apartments are equipped with sprinkler systems. All Residential Life facilities have fire extinguishers in compliance with the applicable code. Fire Safety Education and Training Programs for Students, Faculty and Staff Everyone at MU is responsible for fire safety. MU Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) works closely with the Columbia Fire Department, Campus Facilities, and campus departments to provide comprehensive fire prevention services to campus. These services include building inspections, maintenance of fire suppression systems, fire extinguisher training, and promotional activities . Environmental Health and safety offer a Fire Extinguisher Use and Safety class made up of lecture and hands on opportunities. Stud ents participate in extinguishing fires after having learned about fire prevention and the proper use of fire extinguishers. Classes on fires, along with the types of fire extinguishers available, deciding which extinguisher to use, when to fight a fire wi th an extinguisher, and how to properly use an extinguisher are covered in this class. Contact EHS if you have any questions or desire consultative assistance about fire safety, the use of open flames and other fire related questions. 193 2023 Fire Safety Amenities in University of Missouri Residential Facilities Core Campus Residential Facilities Fire Alarm Monitoring by Off-site service Partial Sprinkler System1 Full Sprinkler System2 Smoke Detection Fire Extinguisher Device Evacuation Plans Placards Number of Evacuation (fire) drills each year3 Bluford X X X X X 2 Brooks X X X", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 156, "word_count": 500}

Plans for Future Improvements in Fire Safety The University of Missouri continually evaluates our fire safety program as well as our fire protection systems. MU makes upgrades based on need and funding. We continue to develop and conduct fire safety training programs as needed to ensure the safety of our students, faculty, and staff. Residential Life owned residence halls are equipped with sprinkler systems and all facilities were updated by 2020. At this time there are no plans for future improvement in fire safety. 195 Procedures for Student Housing Evacuation In case of a fire, for your safety and the safety of others, get out as quickly as possible, and leave the firefighting to the professionals. All residents and guests must evacuate when building fire alarm systems sound. When a fire alarm sounds, all occupants must immediately vacate the building via the suggested evacuation routes and go to the designated location. Students should familiarize themselves with the exits in the building and if there is a specific stairwell assigned for evacuation of their re sidence hall room, they should use that exit. Never use the elevators always take the stairs. Students who fail to vacate the building when an alarm sound endanger the safety of themselves and others and will face conduct action. What to do in case of fire When the fire alarm sounds, you must evacuate the facility. Never assume it is a drill or false alarm; treat each alarm as the real thing. Feel your doorknob before opening it. If the knob is hot, do not open the door. If the knob is not hot, brace yourself against the door and open it slightly. If heat or heavy smoke is present in the corridor, close the door and stay in the room. Keep low to the floor if smoke is present. 196 If you CAN leave the room Wear shoes; if possible, carry wet towels. Close all doors behind you to reduce the spread of smoke. If you are in another part of the building, do not return to your room. Go to the nearest exit or stairway. NEVER USE AN ELEVATOR. If the nearest exit is blocked, use an alternate route. If all exits are blocked, go back to your room and close the door. Follow the procedures described below. Never re -enter the building until staff indicates it is safe to do so. If you CANNOT leave the room If possible, open the window at the top and the bottom to let out smoke and let in fresh air. Do not break the glass. Smoke and fumes may be", "source": "2024-Annual-Fire-Safety-and-Security-Report_Final-1.pdf", "chunk_index": 158, "word_count": 500}

If you CANNOT leave the room If possible, open the window at the top and the bottom to let out smoke and let in fresh air. Do not break the glass. Smoke and fumes may be drawn in through the windows. You must be able to close the window if necessary. CALL 911, shout for help. Seal cracks around the door with towels or bed linens to keep out smoke. Stay near the floor when possible. Hang a sheet, jacket, shirt or other object in or outside the window to attract attention. If you discover a fire, do not endanger yourself Pull the nearest alarm box. Shout a warning. Repeat it. Leave the building and CALL 911, even if a small fire has been quickly extinguished. Close all doors, especially those leading into stairwells, which should never be left open. Move at least 200 feet away from the building. Keep clear of driveways, sidewalks and access pathways. 197 Evacuation Procedures All residents must remain calm, move quickly (no running) and remain out of the way of emergency personnel and associated equipment. When exiting the building and proceeding to the pre -planned assembly area, remain at least twenty feet away from the building walls and overhangs. Facility Evacuation Routes Residential Life is responsible for reviewing designated evacuation routes and assembly points with residents at the start of each semester. Students should be aware of all alternative routes in the event the primary routes are blocked. 198 Evacuation Locations and Assembly Points Residence Hall Assembly Area Bluford WG-6 Parking Lot Brooks WG-6 Parking Lot, far eastern portion closest to Tiger Avenue Center WG-6 Parking Lot, far southern portion closest to Stadium Blvd. College Avenue Dairy Lawn Defoe -Graham South Rec.
