VIIRS satellite data show luminance values of only 1.00 nW/cm\u00b2/sr\u201450% below the safety threshold\u2014resulting in limited visibility during evening and morning hours when burglary risk peaks. Road network analysis indicates a moderate sightline (6.0/10), but the area is set back 1353ft from high-traffic corridors, reducing natural oversight.\n\n**Root Cause Factors**  \n- **Insufficient illumination:** Satellite-measured luminance of 1.00 nW/cm\u00b2/sr, well below the 2.0 safe minimum, creates shadowed areas conducive to burglary (Supported by VIIRS data).  \n- **Limited natural surveillance:** Site is 1353ft from the nearest major pedestrian corridor, lowering informal observation (TIGER/Line road analysis).  \n- **Road density but moderate surveillance:** Presence of four roads within 300ft yields moderate sightlines (6.0/10), yet does not compensate for low pedestrian presence.  \n- **Existing infrastructure gaps:** While a call box is present (0ft), reliance on a single light source 92ft away exposes the location to shadowed intervals.\n\n**Recommended Interventions**  \n1. **Install supplemental LED pathway and building exterior lighting** | **Cost: Medium** | *Predicted reduction*: 35%  \n2. **Trim vegetation and improve site lines along Conley Ave** | **Cost: Low** | *Predicted reduction*: 10%  \n3. **Add additional surveillance cameras and signage (CCTV)** | **Cost: Medium** | *Predicted reduction*: 20%  \n4. **Relocate or add a supplementary call box closer to common footpaths** | **Cost: Low** | *Predicted reduction*: 5%\n\n**Priority Score**  \n**Critical** \u2014 The high incident count, serious burglary cases, and luminance 50% below safety minimum demonstrate urgent environmental risk, justifying top-priority action at this site.",

While the secondary road network provides relatively good surveillance (score 8.0/10), the location is distant from high-traffic corridors and emergency call infrastructure, leading to poor natural surveillance, especially at night.\n\n**Root Cause Factors**  \n- Inadequate illumination: Measured at 1.00 nW/cm\u00b2/sr (50% below the 2.0 nW/cm\u00b2/sr threshold), confirming consistently dim nighttime conditions.  \n- Call box coverage gap: Nearest call box is 1249ft away; campus standard is max 500ft separation.  \n- Limited foot traffic: 1598ft from Greek Town Main Strip, reducing informal observational presence after hours.  \n- High incident rate: 27 total incidents, with 44% at night, and 8 classified as serious/critical\u2014indicating urgent vulnerability.\n\n**Recommended Interventions**  \n1. **Upgrade pedestrian lighting to at least 2.5 nW/cm\u00b2/sr along affected boulevard segment.**  \n   Cost: Medium | Predicted incident reduction: 40\u201350%  \n2. **Install an ADA-compliant emergency call box midway between Rec Center and hotspot.**  \n   Cost: Low | Predicted incident reduction: 15\u201320%  \n3. **Create a direct, well-lit pathway to Greek Town corridor with active landscaping (removing visual obstructions, adding benches).**  \n   Cost: Medium | Predicted incident reduction: 15\u201325%  \n4. **Increase visible patrol presence during late evening on weekends.**  \n   Cost: Low | Predicted incident reduction: 5\u201310%\n\n**Priority Score**  \n**Critical** \u2014 VIIRS data and incident severity underline an urgent risk; all core CPTED principles (lighting, sightlines, rapid emergency access) are currently below safe campus thresholds.

Environmental isolation, especially being 5160ft from a main campus corridor and with no nearby emergency features, increases vulnerability to daytime vandalism and other incidents.\n\n**Root Cause Factors**\n- Insufficient illumination: Only 1.00 nW/cm\u00b2/sr, well below the safe pedestrian threshold (2.0 nW/cm\u00b2/sr), per VIIRS satellite data.\n- Call box coverage gap: Nearest emergency call box is 3838ft away\u2014over 7x the 500ft safety standard.\n- No road network: Zero road presence in 300ft radius (TIGER/Line), reduces both visibility and routine traffic/passive oversight.\n- Low natural surveillance: Site is isolated, with the nearest high pedestrian corridor over 0.9 miles away.\n- High-risk pattern: 18 incidents, including 6 serious, clustered at peak morning hours, suggesting repeat opportunity-based targeting.\n\n**Recommended Interventions**\n1. **Install high-efficiency LED area lighting** along pedestrian paths connecting 3315 Berrywood Dr to nearest main corridors. | **Cost:** Medium | **Predicted Reduction:** 55%  \n2. **Deploy additional emergency call box(es)** within 500ft of hotspot. | **Cost:** Low | **Predicted Reduction:** 20%  \n3. **Create a paved pedestrian walkway** with enhanced visual openness, providing clear sightlines to adjacent campus infrastructure. | **Cost:** High | **Predicted Reduction:** 35%  \n4. **Install CCTV surveillance signage and cameras** targeted to vandalism hot areas. | **Cost:** Medium | **Predicted Reduction:** 40%  \n5. **Landscape management** to trim overgrowth and open visual corridors, promoting natural surveillance. | **Cost:** Low | **Predicted Reduction:** 10%  \n\n**Priority Score**  \n**Critical** \u2014 The hotspot shows high-risk (10/10), 6 serious incidents, and severe lighting/surveillance deficiencies per VIIRS and TIGER/Line.

The local road network offers moderate sightlines (6.0/10 surveillance score), but the area is relatively isolated from high-traffic corridors and critical safety infrastructure.\n\n**Root Cause Factors**\n- Insufficient pedestrian illumination: 1.00 nW/cm\u00b2/sr vs. 2.0 nW/cm\u00b2/sr safety standard (VIIRS).\n- Excessive distance to emergency call box: 2449ft vs. 500ft best practice\u2014delayed emergency response risk.\n- Low natural surveillance: Over 3000ft from nearest high-traffic campus corridor, reducing passive observation.\n- Moderate road network surveillance (6.0/10): Limited oversight and sightline complexity for local roads.\n\n**Recommended Interventions**\n1. **Upgrade Street Lighting**\n   - Install LED fixtures to achieve \u22652.0 nW/cm\u00b2/sr along pedestrian and vehicular paths.\n   - Cost Tier: Medium\n   - Predicted Incident Reduction: 35%\n2. **Install Additional Emergency Call Box**\n   - Place unit within 500ft of hotspot to meet coverage recommendation.\n   - Cost Tier: Low\n   - Predicted Incident Reduction: 15%\n3. **Enhance Natural Surveillance**\n   - Trim vegetation, improve sightlines, encourage foot traffic through landscape design and pathway realignment.\n   - Cost Tier: Low\n   - Predicted Incident Reduction: 10%\n4. **Deploy Surveillance Cameras with Signage**\n   - Focus on key entry/exit points. Promote deterrence through visible, policy-compliant camera signage.\n   - Cost Tier: Medium\n   - Predicted Incident Reduction: 25%\n\n**Priority Score**  \n**Critical** \u2014 Lighting is far below safety thresholds and crime risk is high (10/10), with recurrent drug incidents and three serious cases.
