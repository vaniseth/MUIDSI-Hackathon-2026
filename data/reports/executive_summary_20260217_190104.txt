======================================================================

#1 820 CONLEY AVE
   Risk: High (10.0/10) | Incidents: 12 | CPTED Priority: Critical
   Dominant Crime: burglary | VIIRS Lighting: 1.0 nW/cm²/sr [Dim]
   Environmental Deficiencies:
     ✗ Insufficient illumination: 1.00 nW/cm2/sr (satellite-measured) below 2.0 nW/cm2/sr safe pedestrian threshold [Dim]
     ✗ Low natural surveillance: 1353ft from nearest high-traffic corridor (Student Center to Rec Center)

   CPTED Analysis:
**Environmental Diagnosis**  
820 Conley Ave is a crime hotspot due to inadequate nighttime lighting and moderate natural surveillance. VIIRS satellite data show luminance values of only 1.00 nW/cm²/sr—50% below the safety threshold—resulting in limited visibility during evening and morning hours when burglary risk peaks. Road network analysis indicates a moderate sightline (6.0/10), but the area is set back 1353ft from high-traffic corridors, reducing natural oversight.

**Root Cause Factors**  
- **Insufficient illumination:** Satellite-measured luminance of 1.00 nW/cm²/sr, well below the 2.0 safe minimum, creates shadowed areas conducive to burglary (Supported by VIIRS data).  
- **Limited natural surveillance:** Site is 1353ft from the nearest major pedestrian corridor, lowering informal observation (TIGER/Line road analysis).  
- **Road density but moderate surveillance:** Presence of four roads within 300ft yields moderate sightlines (6.0/10), yet does not compensate for low pedestrian presence.  
- **Existing infrastructure gaps:** While a call box is present (0ft), reliance on a single light source 92ft away exposes the location to shadowed intervals.

**Recommended Interventions**  
1. **Install supplemental LED pathway and building exterior lighting** | **Cost: Medium** | *Predicted reduction*: 35%  
2. **Trim vegetation and improve site lines along Conley Ave** | **Cost: Low** | *Predicted reduction*: 10%  
3. **Add additional surveillance cameras and signage (CCTV)** | **Cost: Medium** | *Predicted reduction*: 20%  
4. **Relocate or add a supplementary call box closer to common footpaths** | **Cost: Low** | *Predicted reduction*: 5%

**Priority Score**  
**Critical** — The high incident count, serious burglary cases, and luminance 50% below safety minimum demonstrate urgent environmental risk, justifying top-priority action at this site.

#2 1199 E STADIUM BLVD
   Risk: High (10.0/10) | Incidents: 27 | CPTED Priority: Critical
   Dominant Crime: harassment | VIIRS Lighting: 1.0 nW/cm²/sr [Dim]
   Environmental Deficiencies:
     ✗ Insufficient illumination: 1.00 nW/cm2/sr (satellite-measured) below 2.0 nW/cm2/sr safe pedestrian threshold [Dim]
     ✗ Call box coverage gap: nearest box 1249ft (Call Box - Rec Center) — exceeds 500ft safe threshold
     ✗ Low natural surveillance: 1598ft from nearest high-traffic corridor (Greek Town Main Strip)

   CPTED Analysis:
**Environmental Diagnosis**  
This hotspot at 1199 E Stadium Blvd is driven by significant environmental weaknesses: satellite lighting analysis shows luminance at only 1.00 nW/cm²/sr—well below the campus safety minimum. While the secondary road network provides relatively good surveillance (score 8.0/10), the location is distant from high-traffic corridors and emergency call infrastructure, leading to poor natural surveillance, especially at night.

**Root Cause Factors**  
- Inadequate illumination: Measured at 1.00 nW/cm²/sr (50% below the 2.0 nW/cm²/sr threshold), confirming consistently dim nighttime conditions.  
- Call box coverage gap: Nearest call box is 1249ft away; campus standard is max 500ft separation.  
- Limited foot traffic: 1598ft from Greek Town Main Strip, reducing informal observational presence after hours.  
- High incident rate: 27 total incidents, with 44% at night, and 8 classified as serious/critical—indicating urgent vulnerability.

**Recommended Interventions**  
1. **Upgrade pedestrian lighting to at least 2.5 nW/cm²/sr along affected boulevard segment.**  
   Cost: Medium | Predicted incident reduction: 40–50%  
2. **Install an ADA-compliant emergency call box midway between Rec Center and hotspot.**  
   Cost: Low | Predicted incident reduction: 15–20%  
3. **Create a direct, well-lit pathway to Greek Town corridor with active landscaping (removing visual obstructions, adding benches).**  
   Cost: Medium | Predicted incident reduction: 15–25%  
4. **Increase visible patrol presence during late evening on weekends.**  
   Cost: Low | Predicted incident reduction: 5–10%

**Priority Score**  
**Critical** — VIIRS data and incident severity underline an urgent risk; all core CPTED principles (lighting, sightlines, rapid emergency access) are currently below safe campus thresholds. Immediate remediation is essential to reduce harassment and serious crime risks.
